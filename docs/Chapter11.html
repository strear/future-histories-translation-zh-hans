<h1 id="protect-the-digital-commons">Protect the Digital Commons!</h1>
<h2 id="socialize-the-cows">Socialize the Cows</h2>
<p>&lt;<em>p.239</em>&gt; Boston Common is the oldest city park in the United States. It began as a sale of land by William Blackstone, a somewhat eccentric Anglican clergyman, to the city of Boston in 1634. Every townsperson contributed a minimum of six shillings to the purchase. Once the sale was completed, there was some dispute over whether the land should be divided between the inhabitants or held collectively. By a narrow margin, as we will see, the latter plan prevailed, and it has been owned by the city ever since.</p>
<p>Since this decision in the 1630s, Boston Common has been used for a variety of purposes: among others, as a dumping ground, to host the gallows, for sports and games, and as a haven for courting couples. It was home to victory gardens during World War One and donated most of its iron fencing for scrap metal in World War Two. Martin Luther King Jr. spoke to enormous crowds gathered on its lawns, and thousands of people came together there to protest the Vietnam War. It evolved as a community space for all these activities before becoming an official park. “Boston Common belongs to the world,” wrote Samuel Barber in his 1914 volume, <em>Boston Common–A Diary of Notable Events, Incidences, and Neighboring Occurrences</em>. “From it radiated the influences that led to democratic as opposed to aristocratic rule.”</p>
<p>&lt;<em>p.240</em>&gt; A commons, like its name suggests, is a commonly held resource. It can be something physical or natural like a park or wild environment; or something abstract, like human knowledge about the laws of mathematics, for example. When we talk about the commons, we mean a set of goods or something of value that is not owned by any individual person, though how a common resource is owned and governed may differ. A commons is something that is collectively shared, and its use and protection affect the entire community.</p>
<p>It is almost impossible to talk about the commons without talking about tragedy. In his widely cited essay, <em>The Tragedy of the Commons</em> (1968), the ecologist Garrett Hardin explained the problem with cows. If everyone were allowed to let their cows loose on common land, there would be no incentive to stop more and more cows being sent out to graze. Each individual is motivated to reap the greatest possible benefit from this common resource–but the resource is finite. Demand gradually overwhelms supply, as the benefit of adding extra cows flows to the individual cowherd, while the collective cost to the commons does not factor into the calculation. Each person consumes more, at others’ expense, until in the end there is no grass for anyone. This is a problem of scarcity, as orthodox economists have been saying for a very long time. The assumption is that humans are not a cooperative species, capable of self-managing a collective resource. Unrestricted demands upon a resource that is finite will inevitably reduce that resource through overexploitation. The commons becomes barren. The commons ends in tragedy.</p>
<p>Hardin’s influential essay was not the first to identify this problem; the conundrum and its possible solutions stretch back millennia. The usual response has been to call for the commons to be split up and each cowherd made responsible for looking after their own pasture, policed by some overarching authority. This gives each an interest in using their plot wisely and avoiding its demise through overuse. Put into practice, this is what happened during the “enclosures” of the eighteenth century, a process the historian James Boyle summarizes as the “conversion into private property of something that had formerly been common property.” The commons was privatized in &lt;<em>p.241</em>&gt; response to its overuse. The tragedy of the commons is therefore often used as a justification for private property rights.</p>
<p>Indeed, this was a fate that threatened to befall Boston Common in its early days, as local families let more and more cows loose on the pasture. The breaking up of the commons and distribution of land among residents seemed the most logical step to solve the problem of overgrazing. Yet Boston circumvented tragedy. The town got together to set limits on the amount of permissible grazing and appointed a keeper to monitor compliance. “People often tested the limits, but the system worked through eight generations,” writes historian David Fischer in his history of the Common. “It succeeded because the town combined the idea of the common with the institution of the town meeting.” This approach to collective management of common resources has been the subject of prolonged research by Nobel Prize-winning economist Elinor Ostrom. She found that tragedy can be avoided by devoting thought and care to the rules for governance of the commons. Ostrom’s work has direct relevance to our digital society.</p>
<p>The scholar David Harvey claims to have “lost count” of the number of times Hardin’s essay has been cited “as an irrefutable argument for the superior efficiency of private property rights with respect to land and resource uses and, therefore, as an irrefutable justification for privatization.” An argument given far less attention by mainstream economists, but which equally avoids the tragedy, is to socialize the cows. (That particular strain of thinking gave rise to <em>The Communist Manifesto</em>.) Such reflection ought to encourage us to reexamine the logic of privatization and the supposedly inevitable fate of the commons, as well as the moral justification for the process by which this happened: enclosure.</p>
<p>This period of enclosure was hardly peaceful. It was an act of violence to the fabric of society at the time, described by one historian as “a revolution of the rich against the poor” and “a long, slow, violent operation.” This was not some polite rearrangement of resources or a civil attempt to save the poor from themselves. Historians Peter Linebaugh and Marcus Rediker describe how it &lt;<em>p.242</em>&gt; represented a clash between two classes and was part of broader European colonial projects:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since the people of the world have, throughout history, clung stubbornly to the economic independence that comes from possessing their own means of subsistence, whether land or other property, European capitalists had to forcibly expropriate masses of them from their ancestral homelands so that their labor power could be redeployed in new economic projects in new geographic settings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Enclosure represented a break in traditions of how people carried out their daily activities. It was not a calm, rational transition to a new and functional society. It created a class of politically powerless people, who feature in the historical records as lawless and violent; it was a period of significant riots across England. This tradition of anti-authoritarian rioting against enclosure that began in England found its way to the American colonies. As a form of political resistance to centralized policies like food hoarding, tax collection and military service, riots were a semi-regular event on Boston Common throughout the eighteenth century, variously attributable to groups such as “negroes and persons of vile condition” in 1747 and “the working classes” in 1768. The eradication of subsistence farming ultimately gave rise to the landless working class. The demise of the commons marked a key transition point away from feudalism toward capitalism.</p>
<hr />
<p>The idea of a commons and its tragedy has largely been associated with natural or physical resources, owned collectively. But the idea of an information commons has existed for almost as long as Boston Common. Since the early seventeenth century, intellectual property rights have been issued over abstract ideas, most commonly over inventions by skilled technicians. Boyle talks about how in its earlier days, intellectual property law actively sought to protect the commons of human knowledge, by granting only limited individual rights over intellectual property, usually for a period of fourteen &lt;<em>p.243</em>&gt; years. The law understood the importance of a store of common materials for all creators and thinkers to draw from. Intellectual property rights over ideas and knowledge were the exception, not the rule.</p>
<p>But over time, particularly during the twentieth century, there has been a transformation of more of human knowledge into property. Information has become more central to generating value under capitalism in the digital age than it was in the past. We can see this in the contours of various technology platforms and the data mining that happens there. But perhaps more significantly, information has also become a much more valuable commodity in industrial settings. Computerized airplanes, cars and other kinds of productive technology operate not as self-contained pieces of machinery, manufactured, tested and sold, but as nodes in a network constantly relaying information back into the design process. Information, whether in the form of aggregated data, controlled research or network feedback, is an increasingly critical component of our economic system.</p>
<p>As information has become a more valuable resource, intellectual property law has acquired unprecedented clout in modern capitalist relations. Digital rights management over e-books and music, for example, reaches inside our devices and controls how we consume things. Company information, held in the minds of the company’s former employees, is locked down by nondisclosure agreements. Takedown notices are issued by courts for peer-to-peer sharing websites. Pharmaceutical companies race to patent various genetic mutations so they can obtain the rights to sell diagnostic testing for that mutation. Through licensing, car manufacturers restrict the kind of diagnostic testing methods that can be used on their vehicle, which is then linked to the kinds of repairs and modifications that can be made. In 2018, a man who built a business helping customers to extend the lifespans of their computers was convicted of conspiracy to traffic in counterfeit goods and criminal copyright infringement. Eric Lundgren had created discs that helped licensed Microsoft users reboot Windows on their old computers when they &lt;<em>p.244</em>&gt; crashed or needed to be wiped, a perfectly legal reactivation of their license rights. Lundgren was imprisoned for his efforts, with Microsoft assisting prosecutors in the case. The concept of intellectual property law holds such sway in society that it facilitates the imprisonment of people who help other people recycle.</p>
<p>This in turn has influenced how we produce things. Each expansion of property claims over these information resources signals what Boyle calls “a vote of no-confidence in the productive powers of the commons.” In other words, it represents an assumption that information will be put to more productive use privately than collectively. As items are withdrawn from the information commons subjected to private property rights that prevent using and building upon this knowledge, we are all diminished by the shrinkage of the pool of knowledge from which people can generate and develop ideas. Boyle talks about how the increasing spread of intellectual property rights, over everything from software to human cells, is a kind of redistribution in the modern age that is similar to the project of privatizing land centuries ago. In other words, one way to think about this expansion of intellectual property in the digital age is as a second enclosure movement.</p>
<p>Open source software, discussed in chapter 6, gives us some idea of how to arrange production better, and it can even suggest other contexts where this model may be successful. But we need to facilitate collective working environments and protect the fruits of these labors. There must be ways to avoid this work being squirrelled away by companies who want to exploit such common resources for their own gain or to enforce systems of consumption that are egregiously wasteful. We need to socialize the cows.</p>
<p>If privately held information is not to become the norm rather than the exception, we need to consider how we can continue to both generate and guard the commons. We are entering an age when information in various forms, but especially digital forms, amounts to a kind of capital–something that can be directed to the purpose of generating profit, something that affects both what we can learn and how we can produce things. For various reasons, legal, political &lt;<em>p.245</em>&gt; and moral, the public has a claim over these goods. The extent to which any of this information can or should be in the commons is a question we have not properly begun to grapple with.</p>
<p>Some information ought not be included in the commons, and some information rightly ought to remain in the hands of individuals. Absolute freedom of information is not justifiable, especially given some of the privacy issues discussed in earlier chapters. But we do need a deeper deliberation about the extent to which we should allow information to be privatized and commodified. There is information that causes great harm if kept under lock and key. To what degree are we prepared to tolerate the enclosure of the digital commons to serve the interests of capitalism?</p>
<p>When the townspeople of Boston were deciding how to manage the land they had purchased in 1634, the original plan had been to split it up, and they elected a committee charged with distributing land to residents. One of the members elected was John Winthrop, who was, as it happened, opposed to the idea. Winthrop saw the Common as a way of “joining one person to another and one generation to the next,” as Fischer records. His passionate belief was the same as he had expressed upon first arriving in America a few years earlier. “We must be knit together in this work as one man,” he had proclaimed then. “We must delight in each other, mourn together, labor and suffer together, always having before our eyes our Commission and Community in the work.” He managed to sway others to his view, and the collective decision was made to abandon the plan. The Commons was saved from the fate of enclosure, and Bostonians all enjoy it as a result. It is this collective spirit that must inform the reclamation and protection of the digital commons.</p>
<hr />
<p>The notion of a digital commons gives us a chance to rethink the hoary old tragedy of the cows. One way to begin is by thinking about what resources ought to be included in digital commons and whether this inclusion creates the same problems as did the proliferating bovines. Creative goods, like books, images, music and software, serve as a good starting point. These goods are unlike almost every &lt;<em>p.246</em>&gt; other resource that we have used or relied on as a society in the past. This is in part because they are not a scarcity in the economic sense; more specifically, perhaps, they are infinite, in that one person’s use of these goods in a digital form does not impair the ability of another person to use them. It makes no difference to the resource how many times it is used, viewed, shared or copied. There is no depletion of <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> when an electronic version of the play is shared in the public domain. It is a resource held in the commons, yet no tragedy looms (other than in the storyline).</p>
<p>The classic approach to regulating the production of these works is to impose requirements on users in the form of payment to the author. That makes sense in a book or record store, but it has the potential to be much more than this on the web. Copyright laws increasingly serve to curtail not just access to knowledge generally but also freedom of association and freedom to speak about certain topics. Proposals to crack down on copyright infringements–justified on the basis of the right of authors to proper payment–often give wide-ranging powers to state agencies to filter the web and limit the accessibility of content to those people and platforms that can afford to pay.</p>
<p>We need to think about these goods differently. These goods are non-rivalrous: there is no competition between people to use a particular work, because it is possible to make an infinite number of copies of that work. The cost of producing a copy is zero. As such, it is often difficult to track where these copies go. Every computer connected to the Internet is a kind of printing press, able to copy and distribute copies of a vast amount of human knowledge with just a few clicks. “It is impossible, or at least hard,” writes Boyle, “to stop one unit of the good from satisfying an infinite number of users at zero marginal cost.” Hence the enormous problem known as piracy. To take an alternative view, then: it is possible to see piracy as the superior mechanism for distributing creative goods.</p>
<p>This is not to say that creative goods do not cost something to create in the first place. Creative works in digital formats take resources to produce or generate the first copy. The writer has to &lt;<em>p.247</em>&gt; draft her book, just like the geeks in the MIT computer lab had to write the code for the computer game Spacewar. Production of the first copy is a challenge. But the point is that after that initial investment of human time and energy, and some equipment, every single subsequent copy of the creative good can be made at zero cost. The infinitesimal amount of light down a fiber optic cable uploading the file onto a common space is pretty much the only cost of additional copies of these goods.</p>
<p>This is why the digital world of creative goods looks so different to the cows hogging the pasture. The digital commons does not suffer from the problem that the grassy commons had: overuse does not lead to tragedy. In fact, by keeping these goods in the commons, accessible freely, they are distributed most efficiently. That creates a strong argument for holding creative goods in the digital commons.</p>
<p>Are there other goods for which the production of a marginal copy is also zero? Arguably, this is true for certain kinds of information, or goods made up of valuable information. Pharmaceutical companies, for example, carry out research and testing to come up with a specific combination of chemicals to treat a certain condition. The direct cost of producing the drug in question may be relatively low. Yet its price will reflect the inputs of time and research that went into making the first copy, so to speak. The marginal cost of producing a single pill may be close to zero, but pharmaceutical companies pile onto the price the costs of generating the first “copy” of that drug, or the information that went into making that copy, as well as a profit margin.</p>
<p>As with cultural goods, then, it is no surprise that intellectual property law has tightened its grip on production processes in the pharmaceutical industry. Rather than intellectual property serving as a method that generates motivation and drives innovation, it ends up in reverse: the prospect of making a profit determines what is produced. Pharmaceutical companies often go to extraordinary lengths to extend their patents, a practice known as “evergreening,” which according to one industry insider necessitates “floors full of lawyers.” As Professor Joel Lexchin puts it: “Typically, when &lt;<em>p.248</em>&gt; you evergreen something, you are not looking at any significant therapeutic advantage. You are looking at a company’s economic advantage.” Resources are devoted not to improving the function of a drug but to protecting the capacity to profit from that drug.</p>
<p>Software is not that different from pharmaceuticals in this respect. The free software movement talked about “free speech, not free beer” because, not long ago, so-called free software often did have a price–that of disks and postage. But as the Internet facilitated more rapid distribution, the physical cost of free software largely disappeared (though many people still donate money for the programs they use). There are differences when compared to the production of medicines, but the analogy allows us to draw a distinction between what drives the setting of a price and where the value comes from. The valuable part of free software was the code and the hours of time and human ingenuity it represented. With drugs, there is a production cost, but the actual value comes from the time and energy put into the research to arrive at a specific combination of ingredients.</p>
<p>In reality, intellectual property law, in the form of patents and copyright, takes things of value that ought to be in the digital commons and creates a state-sanctioned monopoly to sell them. This makes it harder to access these goods and restricts the extent to which they can be used by others to build upon our collective knowledge. The outcome of this protection is astronomical profits. Companies that are dependent on monopolies created by intellectual property make a lot of money. Tech companies Apple and Microsoft and drug maker Johnson and Johnson are all in the top ten most profitable companies in the Fortune 500 list. On average, pharmaceutical companies enjoy the largest profit margin of the five main industrial sectors, bigger than oil and gas, or banking.</p>
<p>This in turn creates rent-seeking behavior, where the expansion of intellectual property rights becomes a profitable activity for companies that hold these rights. It is not just pharmaceutical companies that spend big on lawyers to protect their patents. Large producers of cultural content, such as Disney and Warner Brothers, have lobbied &lt;<em>p.249</em>&gt; for extensions of copyright terms to suit their interests as owners, while failing to further either of copyright’s core aims, namely to incentivize new cultural production and to reward authors. Software companies make use of open source software to build their products, which they package up and sell. Intellectual property law, therefore, functions as a method of raiding the information commons.</p>
<p>The problem with this is more insidious than it might first appear: it is not just the loss of a body of knowledge that would otherwise be freely available. It depletes the productive power of the commons. The digital commons is the space where projects are worked on, where historical context allows integration with more recent initiatives. It allows people to scour the history of human endeavor to look at how problems have been solved in the past and how this thinking might usefully be applied to modern conundrums. It also facilitates the freedom for people to work in different ways, to spend varying amounts of time and energy on various elements of a particular project. The capacity to work in this way is diminished when the information commons is privatized.</p>
<p>Contributing work to the digital commons is the price we pay for using the resources that are preserved there. This kind of contribution–from each person according to one’s ability and skill, to each project according to its need–recalls the aspirations of revolutionaries past. If we are to think about ways in which the kind of open source model seen in the free software movement can be put into practice in other contexts, we need to also understand that it works in no small part, because there is an abundant and growing digital commons of software to draw from.</p>
<p>The Internet itself demonstrates this in practice. The technical standards that the Internet is based on, and ultimately also the foundations of the World Wide Web, are all part of the digital commons. They are entirely open. Any person can create new programs or features on top of what is already offered in these protocols, without having to ask anyone for permission. As Rebecca MacKinnon writes: “The Internet’s inherent value and power come from the fact that it is globally interoperable and decentralized.” It might &lt;<em>p.250</em>&gt; have been otherwise: the basic building blocks of the Internet could have been privatized and licensed out. The closest analogy is cable television (which is a reason why it is commonly used as a metaphor to imagine the world without net neutrality). But unlike cable television, with its restricted access through subscription, we have an Internet that facilitates two-way systems of engagement, where everyone can create their own broadcasting platform for free. Here is an example of the social benefits of the commons post-enclosure. The openness of Internet standards has powered its widespread use; the hosting of its protocols and standards in the digital commons has facilitated this.</p>
<p>The digital commons therefore serves two purposes. First, it facilitates the effective distribution of certain goods. This is especially true when the marginal cost of producing that good is zero. Second, it facilitates production, specifically efficient, collaborative labor. A common body of information avoids duplication and creates economies of scale. It allows open source or peer-to-peer ways of working, the likes of which we have seen deployed so effectively in the free software movement. The idea that the commons can be strip-mined to sacrifice this purpose for the sake of profitability is something that ought to be vigorously challenged. Intellectual property laws hinder both these purposes of the digital commons from being realized.</p>
<p>If we take a step back, then, and think about designing society in a way that makes optimal use of the resources and methods at our disposal, one such test may be: if the marginal copy of a good is zero, it belongs in the digital commons. Setting aside the issue of how we produce the first copy for now, there are good reasons to claim that locating such goods in the commons facilitates superior distribution.</p>
<p>Of course, that does not always mean that such goods must be produced collaboratively. No one would argue, for example, that great works of literature would be improved by designing them in an open source format. <em>Moby Dick</em> would hardly be enhanced by crowdsourcing poetic reflections on whaling. There are deep divisions over whether Jeff Buckley or k. d. lang’s versions of “Hallelujah” are better than Leonard Cohen’s, even though Cohen is the &lt;<em>p.251</em>&gt; author of the work. Attribution in the age of the digital commons is therefore important. So, while copies can be made and distributed at zero cost, and people should be allowed to work on and with creative works, attribution is central to allowing creative pursuits to be acknowledged. Some singular visions of creativity deserve to be respected as individual pursuits. But that does not mean that we do not all benefit from such works being available for reading and analysis in a commons environment. The world is a smaller place when important human creations are closed off from the public.</p>
<p>However, for non-creative goods, like research output in relation to treating health conditions or safety measures as they operate in autonomous vehicles, for example, collaboration is essential. By standardizing and sharing such information, we can avoid reproducing work (and mistakes) already made in the past. This is a life-or-death matter for many people, not something that ought to be sacrificed to preserve a competitive advantage for proprietary companies. Such information could be held in a public trust, managed by a committee with democratic oversight, with the capacity to set rules as to how access to this information is granted.</p>
<p>In terms of the productive potential of the commons, another test complementary to the one articulated above may be: if information has more value as a common resource than a privately held one, it should be held in the information commons. Data about the safety of a computerized airplane has more value if it is commonly shared within the entire aviation industry rather than privately held. It improves safety and efficiency. Data collected from patients that provides information about the success or failure of medical breakthroughs ought to be publicly available, to allow better and faster progress in research (provided this is done with personal consent and meaningful privacy protections). While personal data needs to be treated with special care, data generated for industrial production and manufacturing purposes has value for us collectively, and its commodification is increasingly hard to justify.</p>
<p>The tragedy of the commons is a lesson of economics that belongs in the twentieth century. Just as enclosure represented the end of &lt;<em>p.252</em>&gt; feudalism and the beginning of capitalism, the development of the digital commons ought to mark a new beginning in our history of political economy.</p>
<hr />
<p>It we grow the commons with information and creative goods, the key question becomes how to fund the production of the first copy. The first copy might be a work of art; it might be a drug to cure cancer; it might be the software code for a self-driving car. The question is one of the most important because making the first copy unlike production of marginal copies, involves a finite resource: human labor. People must devote time and energy to creating goods that can increasingly be shared with ease in the digital age. If we want these goods to build the digital commons, what do we know about what drives these innovations?</p>
<p>As a starting point, we need to discard the idea that intellectual property law is a good system for motivating the production of these first copies. Bill Gates may have lamented the alleged thievery of software by his fellow hobbyists, because it denied him the expected reward for his personal investment. But he was surely the exception, not the rule. The free software movement is a living example of how great slabs of code can be written by volunteers without any promise of profit. There are many reasons that people participate in open source projects, including reputational gain, the desire to solve a problem personally encountered, a sense of achievement, and even sheer joy. One study found that the single most common reason that people participate in open source development projects (accounting for 44 percent of responses) is the pleasure of intellectual stimulation. The old way of thinking, that profit is a key incentive for innovation, has no place in the modern world.</p>
<p>When it comes to creative goods, anyone can appreciate how incentives are not simply monetary. Artists and geeks tend to value other rewards. But a contrast is commonly drawn with informational goods. Working on medical research is arguably more functional than the production of art or open source software, for example. Intellectual property rights are necessary, we are told, to ensure &lt;<em>p.253</em>&gt; that people are motivated to conduct this kind of research; medical research is hardly as enjoyable as composing music or writing literature or software. But tell that to Jonas Salk, the man who invented the first successful polio vaccine. He was entirely indifferent to the prospect of profiting from his vaccine. When asked who owned the patent on his vaccine, Salk famously replied: “Well, the people, I would say. There is no patent. Could you patent the sun?” In reality, Salk could not have claimed rights associated with his discovery because it was developed using public money. But his views suggest that profitability associated with medical discoveries is not the key motivator for researchers at the highest level in their field. Motivation for human endeavor, whether it is creative, technological or scientific, is more universal in its essence than it might first appear.</p>
<p>There are, of course, people who are solely driven by money. Perhaps surprisingly (for such a profound question of human existence), there is research that claims to be able to quantify this at around 30 percent. At least half, however, “systematically, significantly and predictably behave cooperatively.” To paraphrase professor Yochi Benkler, who has written extensively on this topic: we all know people who are teachers, and we all know people who are stockbrokers. So it is a mistake to presume that money is the sole (or even predominant) incentive for human behavior, including in more functional areas of activity. Intellectual property law does not foster development that is inherently efficient or necessarily useful for the purposes of producing the first copy of many kinds of goods.</p>
<p>All this is not to say that people do not need to earn money and feed themselves and their families. This is doubtless one of the main reasons why the left has been hesitant around this argument: there is a fear that if we insist that human labor is about more than its monetary value, it will be assigned a monetary value of zero. How we can satisfy people’s material needs and desires is a serious question that warrants careful examination (some suggestions have been offered in earlier chapters). It will involve the radical redistribution of resources, the provision of universal public services, and consideration of how to provide and ensure universal subsistence incomes. &lt;<em>p.254</em>&gt; It is possible to imagine subsidies for creatives and others to give them the space to do important work that we all benefit from. But this ought not stop us from rejecting the specious capitalist logic we are sold, which asks us to embrace the idea of intellectual property and surrender to the degradation of the commons.</p>
<p>Creating and fostering a digital commons will not solve all our production problems. Some kinds of production require expertise, and some require specialist equipment. How this can be integrated into open source production processes is an interesting and often complex question. But almost all production involves human time to some degree, and this justifies approaching these questions from the starting point that they ought to be structured as open source supported by a digital commons.</p>
<p>It is also going to be vital that we think through the implications of commons-based production where it involves personal data. The capacity to collect this kind of information in the digital age creates opportunities to better distribute resources and offers a rich resource for researchers. How we buy food, consume energy or commute en masse, for example, could be analyzed to improve production processes and reduce waste. We can deduce trends from health information collected on a scale larger than ever before possible in human history, offering unprecedented opportunities to advance our understanding of medicine. But it is vital that such data is voluntarily contributed for specific purposes and not sold or reused. We need to respect people’s personal sovereignty over their data, so that consenting to it being shared becomes something based on trust and the common good. Moreover, while the benefits of open source production are easily arguable in theory, the implementation has not been without its problems. This is certainly true in the context of software. Some of these problems have stemmed from the inherent nature of open source design, which gives rise to a quasi-obsession with meritocracy. Participants are judged strictly according to their output, with no understanding of how structural realities play into this. For obvious reasons, as we know, almost all the hackers working in the early days of the free software movement were male, and the vast &lt;<em>p.255</em>&gt; majority of them were white. They almost all hailed from the West and were associated with powerful corporations or universities. The requirement of contributing free labor was a luxury not everyone could afford as easily as they could. It is hardly a surprise to find the inequalities that exist in the world replicated in digital environments. But that does not absolve us of actively making space to identify and overcome them.</p>
<p>These are conundrums that need thinking through in public and transparent ways. But we also need to accept that the digital commons is something worth protecting, which ought to be expanded as much as possible. Next, we need to find ways to keep such information in the commons without compromising our individual privacy. We also then need to work out how to facilitate broad and inclusive participation in open source projects that make use of the commons. All this must be predicated on an understanding that the commons is a vital part of the infrastructure that will allow us to make the most of the digital age, without which we are always going to lose out to the interests of those seeking to profit from the privatization of the commons.</p>

<p>Despite being one of the most visited sites on the Internet and serving as the gateway to all kinds of learning, Wikipedia is often thought of as an anarchic space, lacking in professionalism. It is the butt of many jokes about the unreliability of the Internet, but we lose something if we dismiss it on these terms. The reality is that the site is governed by a complex and evolving set of rules. These rules are broad and flexible but work on the basis that contributors to the platform are able to discuss them and adapt them to suit particular circumstances. Benkler gives one example, involving a dispute about the content of an article about creationism and evolution. The difference in perspective of two contributors to this article was debated and discussed, thrashed out by the participants within the various rules set by Wikipedia that require a neutral point of view and reliable sources. The participants arrived at a compromise without appealing to some higher authority or bureaucratic arbiter. Wikipedia is a space in which the work of &lt;<em>p.256</em>&gt; contributors is self-governed, and the outcomes of this are reached through transparent means (to the extent that many readers are interested enough to consult the archives).</p>
<p>The website has its flaws. One of the most pressing is what researchers have called “uneven geographies of participation”–the strong overrepresentation of posts about and contributors from the global north. This is a problem of access, but it also represents a preoccupation with particular histories, events and processes, often at the expense of those who exist on the peripheries. But as the researchers concluded, these problems are not insurmountable: rather they demonstrate how “the democratizing potential of Wikipedia has not been realized.” Moreover, in spite of its limitations, Wikipedia is more democratic than a book written by a single academic with internal and often unacknowledged bias. This is not to advocate for a rejection of expertise or to dismiss the problem of information gatekeepers being reproduced in digital formats. Rather it is to claim a place for deliberative, informed and transparent methods for assessing human knowledge. Wikipedia has shown how it is possible to manage this.</p>
<p>Wikipedia serves as a working example of how a commonly held resource–in this case a free, collaboratively drafted encyclopedia–can be governed effectively by rules determined in a participatory way. The work of Elinor Ostrom, the Nobel Prize-winning political economist, is instructive in this respect. Ostrom spent her life studying the governance of common resources. She set out a range of guidelines to ensure that these resources would be properly managed, a number of which lend themselves to application in the context of open source production and the digital commons. In particular, her guidelines include ensuring the following: that those affected by the rules can participate in making and modifying the rules; that rules can be matched to specific needs and conditions; that monitoring of behavior is carried out by community members; and that there is an accessible, low-cost method for resolving disputes. These factors are all present in Wikipedia. They provide a good guide for the implementation of digital democracy into the field of &lt;<em>p.257</em>&gt; information production in the digital age and the management of common resources.</p>
<p>More specifically, this can help us formulate some structural preconditions to the success of open source projects that draw on common resources. Many of these can be found in the glossary for an Agile approach to management, commonly used in the software industry and discussed in chapter 6. They include the capacity for the project to be broken down into smaller parts, for example, so participants can work on pieces that suit their skills and motivation levels (in Agile terms, “user stories”). Benkler also talks about finding ways for people to accept the importance of quality assurances on their work. This may include some double handing (having some tasks done twice) or participants’ acceptance of randomized checks. These strategies are commonly used in Agile through pair programming, with workers collaborating on the same computer, and quality assurance tests. It also finds form in pull requests made during software development, where a coder notifies others of changes so they can be checked. Benkler argues that these social norms need to be agreed on, not imposed, for this to work. In other words, as Ostrom suggested, the rules are more likely to be followed if they are drawn up collectively, in less hierarchical formats. People working collaboratively do so better if they understand the rules they are working under and are given a say in how those rules are decided.</p>
<p>GitHub is another worthwhile example to consider. GitHub is an online platform for hosting and managing software as it is developed, so people working on the code can keep track of versions and updates. It gives people a place to host a software project and collaborate easily with others. The concentration and exchange of source code on the platform allows for a different kind of ongoing communication between technologists, industry giants and users. Experimenting with code, submitting pull requests and transparent ratings systems combine to offer the opportunity to create proofs of concept, build reputations, and share and test ideas. Star ratings of code given by peers serves as a form of evidence, a metric of how many forks there are, or how many people are using, copying, &lt;<em>p.258</em>&gt; building on and changing the code. It is an enormous operation, storing vast amounts of code, a resource powered by rules that are largely defined outside standard market practice. It works because people understand, appreciate and accept the rules.</p>
<p>Projects that draw on the commons and use collaborative working styles can, then, be productive and effective, but not because they are anarchic. They work because they have rules, ones that are quite specific and responsive to the conditions in which these collaborations take place. We need to preserve this “invitational quality” of the commons, as Adam Greenfield puts it, and practices and rules that encourage openness and porosity. “To seal off opportunities for participation is to invite metabolic death,” he argues. Instead of relying on a cynical understanding of what motivates people and encouraging them to squirrel away their contributions to compete in a marketplace, we should create structures that encourage freedom to participate. Central to this task is a set of rules for building and using the commons.</p>
<p>GitHub does not exist in a vacuum. It is not immune to the laws of the market. Bought by Microsoft in 2018, its future is unclear. Indeed, the fate of GitHub highlights a significant problem with the commons, namely that under capitalism, it is constantly under threat of being raided. As we know from chapter 6, open source production is capable of creating better products than private enterprise, and having a common repository of code has accelerated production processes in all sorts of ways. But this has not escaped the notice of technology capitalists, who benefit from this resource, contributed by volunteer labor, without having to pay for it. When a common resource exists in a capitalist paradigm, there is inevitably a risk that this resource will be enclosed, absorbed one way or another by the profit motive.</p>
<p>This is a difficult conflict to manage, especially in the absence of an immediate appetite for radical social change. But until we reach that time, the conflict can be an axis upon which to organize and agitate. Just as Ostrom observed the power of participatory rule-making in governing common resources, so too can the defense of the commons be seen as an expanded exercise in generating the &lt;<em>p.259</em>&gt; social conditions necessary to protect it from the profit motive and determine how it is best put to use. If we socialize the cows, so that they belong to everyone, not only does this protect the pasture from depletion, it also means the milk and cream can’t be hoarded by a select few.</p>

<p>When Garry Kasparov lost his game of chess with IBM’s supercomputer Deep Blue, he was sanguine about how this came about: “More quantity makes better quality.” In other words, the vast computational skils of Deep Blue overcame any qualitative advantages Kasparov may have gained through his experience, creativity and instinct.</p>
<p>It is perhaps ironic that one of the key moves made by Deep Blue was probably the result of a computer bug. The computer, unable to select a move, seemingly chose one at random, which, according to one observer, “sent Garry into a tizzy.” It highlights some of the dynamics in the relationship between computers and humans. Humans at times overthink things, whereas computers can make instantaneous decisions based on a sound assessment of what they do and do not know. Computers have no emotions but do have bugs; humans are full of emotions, and these can be their downfall. Computers have an immense and growing capacity to crunch information well beyond any human brain but are ultimately dependent on input from humans. Computers are impressive and useful; humans have other skills that are equally indispensable in solving problems. Some tasks are evidently done better by humans, others by computers.</p>
<p>Computers work best when there is good data, properly obtained, and collectively shared–when there is a respected and flourishing commons. The commons is the foundation for forms of production that make the most of human talent. Eben Moglen calls this “Moglen’s Metaphorical Corollary to Faraday’s Law”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you wrap the Internet around every person on the planet and spin the planet, software flows in the network. It’s an emergent property of connected human minds that they create things for one another’s pleasure and to conquer their uneasy sense of being too alone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lt;<em>p.260</em>&gt; Society has arrived at the point where productive relations are acting as an impediment to the development of productive forces. The old style of doing business–making money from proprietary software, packaging up information as a commodity to preserve its value–is slowing us down as a species. As Nick Srnicek and Alex Williams explain, capitalism “misattributes the sources of technological development, places creativity in a straitjacket of capitalist accumulation, constrains the social imagination within the parameters of cost-benefit analyses and attacks profit-destroying innovations.” The state plays a role also: if such innovations are not commodified by private enterprise, they are captured and controlled by state apparatuses for their own purposes. This orients us toward technologies of oppression and removes scientific knowledge from the public domain, enclosing it in the classified world.</p>
<p>Digital technology in combination with the information commons gives us the chance to accelerate thinking, learning and problem solving. I envision a digital space where we are all encouraged to take collective responsibility, and we all have ownership of both the pasture and the cows.</p>
