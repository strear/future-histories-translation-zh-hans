<p>&lt;<em>p.171</em>&gt; In the foundations of the old law quadrangle at the University of Melbourne there is a plaque. The quad was built in 1854, and the plaque was placed two years later. It commemorates the historic strike by stonemasons on-site. They had downed tools and marched to Parliament, protesting their recalcitrant contractor who was not respecting the length of the workday that had been negotiated. After an inquiry, the government officially sanctioned their demand for an eight-hour day, paving the way for the system to spread to other industries.</p>
<p>The plaque is inconspicuous, and the demand hardly seems radical by today’s standards, but it was the first institutional recognition of a movement that challenged the power of capital all over the world–the movement that brought us the weekend and the eight-hour work day. “[This event] was one of the earliest to establish an officially sanctioned standard at leading sites for a whole industry across a specific region,” writes historian Peter Love. “All the main participants fully understood the significance of what had happened and marked the occasion with a celebratory dinner.” That dinner marked the beginning of the tradition of working-class celebrations &lt;<em>p.172</em>&gt; to commemorate the eight-hour day–which would eventually come to be known as May Day.</p>
<p>The downing of tools in the Antipodes was vitally connected to a large transverse movement around the globe for shorter working hours. It started as a campaign to reduce the working hours of children in England. The Cotton Mills Act passed in 1819 prohibited children under the age of nine from working in cotton mills and limited the work of people under sixteen to twelve hours a day. From here, the campaign for shorter hours for all workers gained traction globally: in 1835, there was a general strike in Philadelphia that won the ten-hour day. A little over a decade later in England, the Factories Act of 1847 mandated a ten-hour day for women and children. Following in the footsteps of the workers of Melbourne in 1854, the campaign for an eight-hour day increased in popularity, with May Day marking an annual international call for the legal protection of the eight-hour day from as early as 1871.</p>
<p>The eight-hour-day movement became popular with workers all around the globe. It was one of the most successful progressive social movements in history. It was internationalist in spirit, attracting support from millions across several continents, and the demand was ultimately enshrined in law in multiple countries. This represents a monumental achievement by almost any standards.</p>
<p>In many ways, the workers who fought for limits to the length of the working day were grappling with problems similar to those that confront society today. Nineteenth-century industrialization transformed the workday in a rapid and unprecedented manner. From a routine of labor that was built around natural limitations, such as seasons, weather and daylight, the industrial revolution brought forth the hellish possibility of ceaseless production. Industrial machinery could run continuously, meaning that the limits of the workday were defined by the physical capacity of human bodies. The time that work finished was determined by their exhaustion, as though people were nothing more than an economic unit. “Human endurance was for many years the sole check upon a day’s labor,” wrote the economic historian Frank McVey in 1902, reflecting on &lt;<em>p.173</em>&gt; this situation in his polemic in support of the eight-hour day. “In these days of industrial concentration and wealth-getting,” he wrote, “the whole industrial machinery is organized for the mere sake of production and the profit incidental thereto. Workers, under such a conception, are regarded as the parts of a machine system instead of members of a society.”</p>
<p>Perhaps most famously, the horror show of the industrial revolution for working people was forcefully put on display by Friedrich Engels in <em>The Conditions of the Working Class in England</em> (1845). In this careful and detailed work, Engels argued that the economic drivers and the health effects of industrialization were such that working people were worse off, even as society was more productive and technologically advanced than it had been a generation or two earlier. “The manner in which the great multitude of the poor is treated by society today is revolting,” wrote Engels. “How is it possible, under such conditions, for the lower class to be healthy and long lived? What else can be expected than an excessive mortality, an unbroken series of epidemics, a progressive deterioration in the physique of the working population?”</p>
<p>In something of a future echo of Engels’s observations, the development of digital technology has correlated with a range of poor outcomes for working people. The rapid development of digital technology in the twenty-first century has meant that work has broken out of its “temporal and spatial confinements.” People in many parts of the world are almost continuously on the job, in the office, on the road or at home, constantly connected to devices. For other workers, the piecework economy has created a precarious existence of short-term gigs and long-term worries.</p>
<p>These trends have coincided with increasingly economic inequality. Wealth inequality is the highest it has been in most countries in thirty years. Inequality of income (annual wages) in a place like America is obscene: the top 10 percent of households receive 28 percent of income. But this at least remains relatively similar to other countries. On the other hand, inequality of wealth (total assets minus liabilities) is more insidious and troubling: the top 10 &lt;<em>p.174</em>&gt; percent of American households own 76 percent of wealth. Interestingly, health indicators are also declining: life expectancy has stalled or even receded for certain sectors of the American and British populations. Death rates among white middle-aged people are on the rise, as a result of things like suicide and increased substance abuse. This is significant because it contrasts with every other age group, every other racial and ethnic group, and equivalent groups in other wealthy countries. Though there is no clear reason for this trend, it seems to be a function of physical pain, financial distress and mental illness.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, millions of people are laboring in conditions that perhaps best reflect the modern version of Engels’s tract in places like China that host the lion’s share of manufacturing of digital hardware. These people work in factories that are often brutal and at times deadly. Production takes place around the clock, at inhuman speeds, for low pay. Fatal explosions are common. Jack Qiu makes a compelling case that factories like those managed by Foxconn practice a form of slavery. Each factory is run like an “independent kingdom,” violence toward workers by private guards is common, and workers have no recourse to any public authority. To leave the job involves clearing immense bureaucratic hurdles, at the risk of forgoing owed wages. In 2010, this situation led to what has been called the “Foxconn Suicide Express”: fifteen workers tried to kill themselves over a period of five months by jumping from tall buildings, leading to the installation of the notorious “suicide nets.”</p>
<p>The problems in the production line of digital technology actually begin even earlier, with tales of misery coming from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Indonesia–places where materials used in hardware manufacturing, such as rare earths and tin, are found. Men, women and children mine these commodities in conditions of slavery, often in the context of conflict. Planned obsolescence in many hardware products means that both the sacrifices made by these workers and the negative impacts on the environment are often tragically redundant.</p>
<p>&lt;<em>p.175</em>&gt; The development of digital technology has exacerbated some of the worst excesses of the labor market under capitalism: more people receive less pay, with little job security, for unfulfilling work that is both destructive and unnecessary. But labor still remains central to the economy; both the making and the running of technology keep society going.</p>
<p>The traditional Marxist understanding is that working people are essential to the production of value under capitalism. Human labor creates value in a way that all the machinery in the world alone cannot: without workers carrying out the relevant tasks, intellectual or physical, there would be no production. Labor is therefore a critically important source of value. It is also relatively abundant and possessed of its own agency. This theory is fundamental to understanding why the profit motive is exploitative, because the worker is paid only for her time and not for the value she actually produces. “Labor is entitled to all it creates!” as the slogan of the labor movement goes. But this observation is also critical for understanding the centrality of workers–that without them the system of production stops, and that an abundance of labor, or surplus of workers, acts as a disciplinary force. To function, the economy needs people to work, but people are also frightened of losing their jobs, which is almost always their sole means of survival. All this means that labor is a source of oppression under capitalism but also a potential source of power.</p>
<p>The aristocracy represented the ossified capriciousness of wealth distribution that Paine confronted in pre-revolutionary America; Engels denounced the horrors imposed on workers by industrialists in nineteenth-century England. The leaders of technology capitalism fall into a similar category today. Their much-lauded intellect and innovations are directed toward inflating and jealously guarding the wealth they accumulate and helping their fellow captains of industry to do the same. They are indifferent to the miseries they inflict on countless people; they see themselves as noble individuals pursuing their divine right to make money. Yet this is only possible through the exploitation of labor. Which also means that organized labor still holds the power to transform society.</p>
<p>&lt;<em>p.176</em>&gt; The digital age has created what law professor James Besson has labelled “today’s great paradox.” He outlines how digital technology has transformed creativity, communications, entertainment and work practices, but one key aspect of our lives that has languished under the influence of new technology is our pay. Contra the previous century, in which technological development overall improved the living standards of working people, it seems that in the last few decades technology has contributed to “a loss of jobs and pay for many ordinary workers, while the pay of top earners has grown dramatically.”</p>
<p>Part of the reason for this is that the automation of production has a significant impact on job opportunities for low-skilled workers. For example, automation of the haulage and delivery industry is likely to eliminate most driving jobs in the next decade. As the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> observed, “at risk is one of the most common jobs in many states, and one of the last remaining careers that offer middle-class pay to those without a college degree.” This kind of warning might seem dramatic–humans are adaptable and have always found ways to redeploy their skills as the economy changes. But the anxiety around these discussions is nonetheless justified. It should be a good thing that the automation of driving will result in safer roads and more efficient logistics and transportation. At the same time, this development promises a world of misery for poor and working-class people, particularly those without qualifications, who will have even fewer decent job opportunities. Commentators often refer to this phenomenon in terms of the “robots eating all the jobs.”</p>
<p>But the story is not straightforward. Marc Andreesson, for example, takes pride in debunking this prophecy, with the optimism of a venture capitalist that a truck driver might be less inclined to share. He denies the premise that there is a fixed amount of work to be done (something he spuriously labels as “Luddite”). For him, there will always be more markets–more human needs and wants–to capitalize on. Entrepreneurs have a happy knack of finding new ways to make money, capture more market share, and monetize what has previously been unexploited, off-limits or &lt;<em>p.177</em>&gt; considered unnecessary. As the door of one industry starts to close, windows to the industries of tomorrow are already opening. The future of technology capitalism is thus accumulative: for the system to continue and grow, entrepreneurs will attempt to commodify more of our lives. They will increasingly try to apply the profit motive to facets of human society that function on the basis of communal values, as we have seen in the improperly labeled “sharing economy.” Or they will try to make money by generating useless wants–the over-servicing of the class of people who can afford it. The implication is that anyone left behind in this process exhibits a lack of the entrepreneurial zeal that technology capitalism lionizes above all other human faculties.</p>
<p>The survival of capitalism is also dependent on using technology to extract more from workers wherever possible. Companies are investing in technology that allows them to reduce their labor requirements through data-driven scheduling, and the costs of such arrangements fall to workers to bear. The increasing adoption of this kind of technology is responsible in part for the rise in casualization of labor over the last several decades. Nearly 60 percent of American workers (around 80 million people) are paid by the hour, and nearly half of these are subject to just-in-time scheduling, with no certainty about hours or start times. When we are at work, we are watched more closely than ever. We carry devices connected to the cloud, for example, which monitor every task and the time it takes to perform. The much-derided consumer version of Google Glass has been reincarnated as a workplace management tool, to better track every task assigned to a worker. Amazon is patenting a wristband to squeeze more out of its workers by guiding their movements so they can pack items more quickly. Employers are making the most of technology for the purposes of optimizing how they use and monitor labor.</p>
<p>Automation is creating a world where lower-skilled jobs are much more tightly managed, and higher-paid jobs require rarefied and increasingly complex skill sets. Though it does not necessarily mean a world with less work, the nature and terms of work available &lt;<em>p.178</em>&gt; through the labor market are changing. The labor market is increasingly characterized by numerous manual, precarious jobs and fewer better-paid jobs that demand cognitive thinking and entrepreneurialism. This is the future that twenty-first-century capitalism presents to us.</p>
<p>Estimates vary, but current figures suggest that globally almost half of all activities people are paid to do at present have the potential to be automated. Very few occupations will completely disappear, but six in ten have at least 30 percent of constituent activities that could be automated. This might mean many things, from requiring a worker to use a computer on the job, to full-scale replacement of the worker. But it will mean that many people will be under- or unemployed, creating a surplus of labor. Statistically, under- and unemployment is growing, and the jobs that do exist pay less and work people harder. If this surplus of labor is a consequence of automation, its existence has always served an important purpose for capitalism. A group of people without work, snapping at the heels of those with unskilled jobs, can be used to corner the working class into submission–depressing wages and creating competition for jobs. The existence of surplus labor means people are forced to accept increasingly precarious working conditions or risk being replaced. There is a socially imposed level of unemployment that companies and governments are prepared to accept, because it acts as a disciplinary force on those who do have jobs.</p>
<p>But it is also important to note that investment in automation is not inevitable or linear. Improvements in efficiency and the elimination of jobs via automation tends to be associated with recessions. For example, the 2008 recession not only saw workers replaced by technology, it also imposed elevated requirements on new hires, who needed IT expertise to work with their new electronic “colleagues.” Traditionally low-skill jobs were eliminated and replaced by posts that required more education. This has created what has been called “jobless recoveries,” where recessions are replaced by economic growth but with only sluggish growth in job creation. The fallout of this trend, magnified during times of systemic economic &lt;<em>p.179</em>&gt; stress, affects the more vulnerable sectors of the population. This represents an enormous amount of human suffering; it also reveals the slothful nature of the capitalist class. Rather than rushing to take advantage of new, cost-cutting technologies (the orthodox expectation of how they might respond to market forces), the capitalist class is recalcitrant, only prepared to invest in automation when recessions make the exploitation easier and necessary to justify. They are a class of people who are both torpid and grasping.</p>
<p>Technology capitalism is creating a future of increased commodification and exploitation, which should not be confused with efficiency and progress. The process of automating work, when carried out under capitalism, results increasingly in disparity in income and greater pressure on people to work harder and longer. It also produces a growing class of workers with fewer rights and less security, sometimes called the “precariat,” who survive off the gig economy, doing piecemeal work to scrape together a living with no protection from economic change and no long-term security. This system relies on the surplus of labor as an effective deterrent to labor and political radicalism. Many people, including some on the left, like to talk about the centrality of work to our sense of purpose and dignity. David Frayne, in his insightful and intelligent dissection of the modern concept of work, critiques this thesis. Work is in principle how we acquire income and a sense of identity, make a contribution, find community; yet all too often, he observes, “work has also become an extremely unreliable source of these things.”</p>
<p>Automation under our current system–where retraining is expensive and the welfare net is minimal–wastes the potential of both workers and technology. It creates the paradox of both increased productivity and impoverishment. Outsourcing work to machines, particularly if the task is boring or dangerous, is a highly worthwhile goal, but it is not one that we are moving toward under the current system. And those who will suffer under successive waves of automation will often be the most vulnerable layers of society–the worst-paid, with the fewest skills and the fewest resources to fall back on in times of crisis. Nick Srnicek and Alex &lt;<em>p.180</em>&gt; Williams emphasize the importance of making full automation “a <em>political demand</em>, rather than assuming it will come about from <em>economic necessity</em>.” Technology does not guarantee greater wealth for a tiny minority, nor does it promise a world without work. Its impact will depend on policy choices and who fights for them. But to be humane and just, automation must be part of an agenda in which its benefits are more equally distributed.</p>
<hr />
<p>What kind of political program would we need to accelerate automation and allow the benefits of this development to be shared better? One of the central tenets must be to work less: to reduce the time devoted to waged labor but without a reduction in wages. We need to reverse the idea that efficiencies gained via automation can be the pretext for greater exploitation by employers.</p>
<p>The idea of a future with less work is not new. Perhaps most famously, John Maynard Keynes, writing in 1930, predicted that the accumulation of capital and the development of technology were leading to a whole new kind of existence for human beings: “For the first time since his creation man will be faced with his real, his permanent problem–how to use his freedom from pressing economic cares, how to occupy the leisure, which science and compound interest will have won for him, to live wisely and agreeably and well.”</p>
<p>Keynes believed we were on the brink of creating a society that could meet the subsistence needs of humans–or a society in which human beings had the resources to feed, clothe and care for everyone. The outcome would be a transformation of productive work into something that was minimally necessary but no longer dominant in human existence. Keynes predicted a three-hour workday, or a fifteen-hour week, to spread as thinly as possible the collective task of creating a society of abundance. He regarded the “technological unemployment” already resulting from industrialization and technological development not as something to be lamented but rather as representative of the growing pains of a society moving toward a future of less drudgery and greater output.</p>
<p>&lt;<em>p.181</em>&gt; Karl Marx, writing even earlier than Keynes, was similarly ambitious about the future of productive work: he imagined the possibility of a workday that lasted six hours, rather than the twelve that were the norm in his time. The consequence of large-scale industrial machinery, Marx imagined, would be the transformation of the role of human labor to the point where productive work became simply “conscious linkages” between the “mechanical and intellectual organs” of automated machinery. For Marx, the outcome of this would be</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the free development of individualities, and hence not the reduction of necessary labor time so as to posit surplus labor, but rather the general reduction of the necessary labor of society to a minimum, which then corresponds to the artistic, scientific etc. development of the individuals in the time set free, and with the means created, for all of them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The emergence of surplus labor represented a problem for the laboring classes, but it also symbolized the possibility of liberation. Marx pictured a society in which “nobody has one exclusive sphere of activity, but each can become accomplished in any branch he wishes.” In other words, a society where it is possible for everyone “to hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, rear cattle in the evening, criticize after dinner … without ever becoming hunter, fisherman, herdsman or critic.” Productive work was something that would be increasingly outsourced to machines, with people still supervising production but much more free to pursue a range of interests at leisure.</p>
<p>These writers were representative of a larger, more widespread sense that the future would incorporate less waged labor. Like the technological utopians we met in chapter 5, many people of past generations found the likelihood of a world with less work but more production, sufficient to meet social needs, entirely plausible. To revolutionaries like Marx, to those who like Keynes preferred a regulated form of capitalism, to the many millions who joined the eight-hour-day movement and countless others, less work seemed self-evidently like a progressive step toward a better society.</p>
<p>&lt;<em>p.182</em>&gt; We are not inching closer to this reality; we are drifting further away. More people are working longer hours, in more jobs. Automation under capitalism is not oriented toward living “wisely and agreeably and well.” Instead it has created a deep, abiding moral order that binds merit to hard work. This is a culture that starts at the very top–the ruling elite of the twenty-first century are no longer slovenly landed gentry or lazy heirs to vast fortunes. They are intensely hardworking, and they believe that gives them an entitlement to wealth. This attitude was chillingly exemplified in an anonymous Wall Street trader’s letter to Occupy in 2011:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are Wall Street… We get up at 5am &amp; work until 10pm or later. We’re used to not getting up to pee when we have a position. We don’t take an hour or more for a lunch break. We don’t demand a union. We don’t retire at 50 with a pension. We eat what we kill, and when the only thing left to eat is on your dinner plates, we’ll eat that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We also find it in the start-up selling “Soylent,” a nutritionally balanced meal replacement that allows busy Silicon Valley types to free up time that might otherwise be wasted cooking. The body-optimizing and time-hacking ethos of Soylent sluggers shares something with the trader’s invective: a smug belief in the cultural and moral connection between productivity and self-worth. Keynes foresaw this problem: “We have been trained too long to strive and not to enjoy,” he wrote. The exclusive valorization of a meritocratic work ethic promises misery, overproduction, inequality and the marginalization of anyone who is unable to participate in this competition for exploitation. It is a mind-set we need to resist.</p>
<p>Working people have the capacity to do this. As an essential element of capitalist production, they also hold the power to shut it down. It is time to revive the international demand for shorter work hours, for the reduction and equitable redistribution of waged work. Our goal should be a six-hour day, leading to a five-hour day; a three-day weekend en route to a three-day week. We need to reclaim &lt;<em>p.183</em>&gt; time from the destructive and exploitative work ethic that dominates current conversations about labor.</p>
<p>Frayne calls for a return to the <em>politics of time</em>: “a concerted, open-minded discussion about the quantity and distribution of working time in society, with a view to allowing everybody more freedom for their own autonomous self-development.” This also happened to be a key motivation of the eight-hour-day movement: to minimize unemployment through the equitable distribution of waged work. At the unveiling of a monument in 1903 to celebrate the historic achievement at Melbourne University half a century earlier, the labor organizer Tom Mann declared that the aim of the movement was to abolish poverty and do away with the unemployed, and the only means of accomplishing that was to have a shorter working day. (He called for a six-hour day, and reports indicate that the crowd joyfully concurred.) Relaunched today, such a movement would also create employment opportunities for the people who are currently considered surplus to requirements by the capitalist class, and thus undercut the capacity to use those spare workers to keep the others in line. In other words, as Frayne puts it, “everyone should work less so that everyone can work.”</p>
<p>Organized labor has traditionally demanded both bread and roses–the right to decent pay but also conditions of dignity and beauty. As well as reducing the hours devoted to work, the stonemasons in Melbourne were motivated by the desire to transform work into something that was carried out under reasonable conditions that allowed workers to flourish personally. A shorter workday was necessary to deal with the harsh climate of Australia but also reportedly “to give the worker time to read and study, and to progress in knowledge and virtue”; to make them better people, inclined toward “self-respect, and respect for other[s]” and “domestic virtues and good citizenship.” The campaign for an eight-hour day was “a public necessity,” as another writer put it, “as a means of giving to men a wider interest in life, the possibility of greater culture, and the surety of education commensurate with the problems now forced upon our democracy for solution.”</p>
<p>&lt;<em>p.184</em>&gt; Taking inspiration from this framing, we can demand an end to technologies of workplace organization that squeeze more from workers at the expense of society, such as data-driven scheduling and surveillance technologies. This kind of technology creates a harsh climate of uncertain and irregular hours of frenetic work, with families and communities bearing the consequences. Work needs to be a place where people enjoy conditions of respect rather than discipline. We should ensure that improvements in productivity that have come about through automation are enjoyed by all those who work and contribute to production, not just converted into profit for their employers.</p>
<p>We can also use this discussion to campaign for time for other pursuits, away from waged work. The law should drastically increase the costs of overtime and impose a prohibition on work beyond a weekly cap of hours. This has a specific relevance for the digital age: France recently instituted legal protection of “the right to disconnect,” meaning that workers have no obligation to send or respond to emails outside of working hours. This has taken the form of server shutdowns overnight and automatic deletion of emails sent outside of business hours. A similar law is now being mooted in New York City. In the Netherlands, workers have the right to demand reduced hours and cannot be penalized for exercising this right. It is possible to imagine other legislative proposals that incrementally dismantle the culture of long hours and allow working people to learn new things, contribute to public policy discussions, and become greater contributors in their communities and homes.</p>
<p>The demand to reduce working hours and redistribute socially necessary labor requires us to reorient: from understanding value in terms of money to measuring value in time, well-being and sustainability of the planet. Reducing the number of working days has been credibly shown to reduce climate emissions, by cutting the emissions associated with commuting and the energy costs of running workplaces. The State of Utah experimented with this by reducing the days worked by state employees for a number of years, and researchers documented the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. &lt;<em>p.185</em>&gt; Public discussion around the politics of time would also help us find ways to minimize pointless work. It would force us to consider what kind of work might be necessary for a functioning society and what kind of jobs are actually “bullshit,” as the anthropologist David Graeber describes them. It would mean our collective decisions about production were actually responsive to the climate we find ourselves in and our needs as a society. The market is evidently a terrible decision-maker in this respect, because, as Graeber puts it: “In our society, there seems a general rule that, the more obviously one’s work benefits other people, the less one is likely to be paid for it.” It would be a world with more nurses and teachers, fewer corporate lawyers and stock traders. Fewer speculative entrepreneurs and more people working together to address urgent, concrete problems like climate change at a global and local level.</p>
<p>Just as the original movement for a shorter working day took off in the decades after the industrial revolution, so too can this claim be made legitimately today, in the wake of technological developments that elevate our collective productive capacity. It would be an example of the living legacy of what began with Paine, was demanded by Marx and was imagined by Keynes. It would be the continuation of a tradition that attracted millions of followers in the form of the eight-hour-day movement. It will take a new system of production–where we encourage automation and reduce working hours without loss in pay–to allow the ideal society with the minimum of socially necessary work to come into being. We need to borrow from our forebears and adapt their tactics to our present situation. We need a movement that calls on digital technology to allow one to become a hunter, fisherman, herdsman and critic all in one day. We need a society in which human life is not judged by its productive output or income or wealth, one in which technology is directed toward creating space for the multiplicity of the self to blossom.</p>
<hr />
<p>The potential of automation to create a world with less waged work is exciting, even if we can only see glimpses of it today. Digital &lt;<em>p.186</em>&gt; technology has the capacity to create a world where production is more efficiently carried out by machines, but an essential part of achieving this goal is to give more power to workers in carrying out their jobs. If workers are given the chance to engage meaningfully with their work, to learn skills and test them in practice, they can feed that knowledge back into productive processes in ways that are highly effective. The transformation of work via automation does not necessarily mean a fixed future of robots eating jobs, but it does create an opportunity for robots to eat the rich.</p>
<p>“Technology implementation is challenging,” Besson writes, “because large numbers of workers need to acquire new skills and technical knowledge.” Technological development in these contexts is best thought of not just as bright ideas, such as the steam engine or the microchip, but as a combination of those bright ideas and their implementation or maintenance. Education in this context is not simply a matter of degrees or qualifications but rather engagement with technology that builds skills and knowledge. Put another way: people working with new inventions and technological developments often contribute significantly to the improvement of these inventions over time. By working with technology collectively, we are more likely to improve that technology and get the best out of what innovations have emerged.</p>
<p>Worker cooperatives offer a format for production that can efficiently adapt to new technology. They come in many different forms, but, in general, worker cooperatives are enterprises in which workers own the bulk of the firm collectively and management decisions are made with the democratic participation of the worker-owners. Such organizations exist all over the world, particularly ir North America, Latin America and Europe, in a range of industries and in varying sizes. A good example came out of the attempted closure in 2008 of Republic Windows and Doors in Chicago. The business was still profitable, but the owners wanted to shut the company down and set up a similar business using temporary labor. The workers fought back: resisting the dismantling of the business, they eventually gathered together the capital to purchase the &lt;<em>p.187</em>&gt; company themselves. There are now twenty-three worker-owners running the business successfully. They renamed themselves New Era Windows Cooperative.</p>
<p>The driving force behind these enterprises is active participation in management decisions by workers. This results in not just a broader set of ideas about how to organize labor; critically, it generates knowledge-sharing about work–something that is highly valued but difficult to cultivate in more orthodox business structures. Structuring organizations in this way creates the strongest incentive among workers to be creative, take responsibility, avoid unnecessary conflict, and monitor and improve performance. In other words, to educate themselves and each other on how best to work with technology. Worker cooperatives are places where workers can play with new skills. They can learn, practice and experiment with new ways of doing things. They can share knowledge and feedback, confident that they will also share in the benefits of any higher productivity that may come about as a result. “If we make a mistake, we talk to each other and we find a solution,” explains Armando Robles, a worker-owner of New Era Windows. “We try to do the best for everyone. We work harder because we’re working for ourselves. But it’s more enjoyable.”</p>
<p>Again, here we see the seeds of the future being planted in the present. So much of what is often called the sharing or gig economy–enterprises like Uber, Airbnb, Zipcar, Task Rabbit–are well suited to being modeled as worker cooperatives rather than profit-making companies. These workers themselves understand the possibilities of organizing themselves. Knowledge-sharing networks exist for Uber drivers, for example, that help them navigate the complexities of their working environment and help researchers to document the challenges of this form of employment and make them visible to the public. For obvious reasons, often companies have tried to ban or marginalize these initiatives. Encouraging them and providing them with the protection of law is an essential demand for a modern labor movement. There have also been some experiments in organizing these kinds of platforms directly as &lt;<em>p.188</em>&gt; cooperatives. They have produced mixed results, but the prospect remains promising, particularly in models that give the most control in management decision-making to workers.</p>
<p>The gig economy has often used digital technology to scale up specific social values, including the value of self-directed work, the efficient use of limited resources via sharing, the importance of trust and an interest in building a community. If we imagine the possibility of re-socializing these models of work, through giving control back to workers, we glimpse a promising vision of the future of work.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, under our current system it is well-documented that the gig economy is full of highly exploitative companies–exploiting both the people who rely on them for a livelihood and the communities in which they operate. When geared to making money, companies in the sharing economy end up risking the destruction of the very values that made them so successful in the first place, such as openness, a sense of community and goodwill, and a willingness to share. The problem is when companies capitalize on these values to pursue profit rather than distribute the benefit to others They operate according to the rules of the marketplace rather than rules set by a democratic process. But this outcome is only possible because of a certain approach to history that has permeated the age of digital technology. As Tom Slee points out: “The Sharing Economy’s complete neglect of the history of collaborative and cooperative movements is one of the reasons it has been so easy for business to co-opt.”</p>
<p>We are already moving into a world where work can be be flexible, self-directed, prioritize the sustainable use of resources, and be based on trust and community-building. It is possible to imagine how gig enterprises could be transformed into worker cooperatives to ensure that the benefits of working in this way accrue not just to company owners but also to the people who are actually doing the work. To do so might require certain interim policies, such as tax breaks for cooperatives or finding ways to facilitate the transition to worker ownership when a company becomes insolvent. It could &lt;<em>p.189</em>&gt; also take the form of unions demanding a form of ownership, even control of members’ workplaces. When workers have a greater opportunity to participate in decisions about how things are done, it is easy to see how the worst kinds of work will gradually be prioritized for automation. “Bullshit jobs,” like flunkies for management or fixers of nonexistent problems, would be deprioritized, even rendered unnecessary once there was greater feedback between people making strategic decisions and people doing the work. The necessary skills for adapting to new technologies would be openly shared. This model takes the advantages of digital technology–its capacity to scale up a sense of trust and community–and distributes them far more broadly than is the case at present.</p>
<p>The deep sense of solidarity and collaborative nature of worker cooperatives creates conditions for a bold and active vanguard of working people able to generate demands for automation and redistribution. Traditional unions are still critical, but we also need to think more expansively about organizing in the age of automation. Many of the companies that are growing exponentially in the digital age are well suited to these kinds of structures. Companies that rely on the sharing economy offer a glimpse of how the future might look, but not for the reasons that their CEOs like to think.</p>
<hr />
<p>A more democratic approach to automation will prioritize politics that reduce exploitation and inequality, and look outside of market forces to make decisions about how we produce things. But even in a world with less waged work, there will be inequality, as some kinds of labor will be valued in productive terms more than others. We need an agenda for a society that ensures that people both contribute fairly (working in conditions of fairness, not exploitation) and are adequately provided for (with resources redistributed according to needs, not market incentives). Reducing hours is an important part of achieving the former. In respect to the latter, Thomas Paine might argue that it is high time that we demand that a ground rent be paid.</p>
<p>There is a divide among the left over the form that this ground rent should take–that is, what kind of policies are best suited to &lt;<em>p.190</em>&gt; redistributing the benefits of automated production. Some authors, like Nick Srnicek and Alex Williams, argue for accelerating the process toward full automation as part of a modern left vision of a post-scarcity economy. Others, like Adam Greenfield, are more skeptical about the likelihood of such a prospect. As Greenfield points out, some of the most radical sections of the working class constitute the very parts of the economy that will be automated the quickest. If we do aim for a world with less waged labor, what kind of redistributive mechanisms should we implement to ensure that this is empowering rather than immiserating? What does a modern equivalent of a ground rent look like for the digital future?</p>
<p>I would argue there are three things we need to consider: how to ensure people are paid properly, how to organize productive work responsibly in ways that recognize the importance of other kinds of work, and how to ensure that people’s basic needs are met. There is a range of different ideas and proposals to help us think about how these goals can be achieved.</p>
<p>The basic income (often called a universal basic income) finds its philosophical roots in the concept of a “groundrent” floated by Paine over two centuries ago. Writing in 1920, Dennis Milner was arguably the first person to formulate an explicit argument in favor of a basic income, an argument that took the form of a pamphlet circulated among the British Labour Party. Charity was not the answer to poverty, it said; higher production would only come about when certain conditions were met. Milner argued for the twin needs of “food and freedom”: citizens need food and shelter as well as freedom to control their lives. These needs could be fulfilled through regular payment of a sum of money to all citizens, without qualification.</p>
<p>Nearly a century later, similar proposals have taken hold in a number of countries. A basic income has been or is being considered by major social democratic parties in the UK, where it enjoys popular support, and Canada. A proposal was considered in Switzerland. An experimental program in Finland, introduced with significant fanfare, was subsequently abandoned. (That controversial decision struck many commentators as premature and appeared &lt;<em>p.191</em>&gt; to be justified on the basis of poor design.) Meanwhile, a form of it has existed in Brazil for decades.</p>
<p>But the concept also has right-wing proponents. Milton Friedman was a supporter, on the basis that it would reduce the role of government. More recently, the elite of technology capitalism, including Mark Zuckerberg, Marc Andreessen and venture capitalist Sam Altman, have backed the policy. Libertarians have proposed doing away with the welfare state entirely, to be replaced by a single, flat-rate universal payment. From this perspective, a basic income serves to safeguard the long-term prospects of capitalism and accelerate speculative entrepreneurialism. It serves as a facilitator of free-market functionality rather than a limitation on market extremes. In this way, it has the potential to paper over the structural features of technology capitalism that exacerbate inequality. There is no brake on the expansion of consumerism, no slant toward sustainability in a context where market forces dominate decision-making about public resources and collective problems. The people who will pay the price are those who make up the class of surplus labor–those whom the market renders expendable, who struggle to find work in this fragmented economy. If a basic income becomes the excuse to replace universal social programs, like education, health and welfare, as part of liberating markets, it will herald a form of death-cult capitalism.</p>
<p>This approach is emblematic of how Silicon Valley’s understanding of poverty is seen as a design problem to be tinkered with and solved by structuring redistribution in ways that ignore the underlying problem. These thinkers are enamored with the free market, ignoring its relentless drive to colonize every aspect of human existence, glossing over its incapacity to effectively manage common resources and its structural tendency to externalize a range of economic, social and environmental costs. The elite of technology capitalism want to use a basic income to soften the edges of the labor market in a time of technological change, so that they can continue to do what they do best: exploit people for profit.</p>
<p>Is, then, the basic income a radical redistributive proposal or is it a way for capitalists to preserve their power? The answer will depend &lt;<em>p.192</em>&gt; on who demands it and how. It could be a technocratic lifeline to subsidize rentier capitalists, or it could give everyone a substantively equal share in the productive output of a sustainable society. Either way, it is a debate that we appear to be having. Rather than outright reject it, the left needs to respond to the prospect of a basic income as a starting point for further demands for a better, more sophisticated approach to redistribution of wealth. Failure to do so will allow the contours of the debate to be defined by the elite, who are increasingly discussing it on their own terms.</p>
<p>In this context, it is critical that we understand the benefits of a basic income. The first concerns the role of the judgmental and time-consuming bureaucracy around welfare, the effect of which is to make government assistance difficult and humiliating to claim. The introduction of a basic income would be a marked improvement on current arrangements.</p>
<p>A basic income would also involve a kind of welfare that has repeatedly proven to be effective: giving poor people cash. Cash payments are highly efficient, particularly as there are few implementation costs, and cash has multiplier effects that the delivery of goods and services does not create. Allowing people agency over their welfare provision and expenditure has the potential to be empowering.</p>
<p>Perhaps most importantly, the concept of a basic income also gives legitimacy to a great deal of work that has traditionally been dismissed as nonproductive. Implemented as a universal proposition, a basic income is not attached to waged employment, as are tax credits or statutory work entitlements. Reproductive labor in the home, such as care work and housework, has traditionally been invisible to the economy. A basic income offers a form of payment and creates the potential for this labor to be valued financially for the first time in a meaningful way. It also has the potential to liberate the many people (mainly women) whom this kind of duty often excludes from other earning opportunities and confines to a life of abuse, control and isolation. A similar argument can be made for individual endeavors that benefit the community as a whole, &lt;<em>p.193</em>&gt; including making art, volunteering, political organizing, and public participation in policy-making. Public participation in decision-making could be elevated in all sorts of new and interesting ways if the vast majority of people were relieved of their dependency on waged work for financial security.</p>
<p>In other words, a basic income has the potential to undercut the Wall Street mantra about growth and jobs, productivity and individual worth. It is predicated on an understanding of productive work not as something indispensable to our sense of value but as something that should be limited to what is socially necessary and increasingly just a small part of what makes us human.</p>
<p>Alongside this, we need to consider how productive, waged work could be more democratically organized to meet the needs of society rather than individual companies. To this end, one commonly suggested alternative to a basic income is a job guarantee. The idea is that the government offers a job to anyone who wants one and is able to work, in exchange for a minimum wage. Jobs could be created around infrastructure projects, for example, or care work. Government spending on this enlarged public sector would act like a kind of Keynesian expenditure, to stimulate the economy and buffer the population against the volatility of the private labor market. Modeling suggests that this would be more cost-effective than a basic income (often critiqued for being too expensive) and avoid many of the inflationary perils that might accompany basic income proposals. It also could be used to jump-start sections of the economy that are politically important, like green energy, carbon reduction and infrastructure. A job guarantee could help us collectively decide what kind of work is most urgent and necessary and to prioritize that through democratically accountable representatives.</p>
<p>But a job guarantee, when compared to a basic income, has its own drawbacks. It reinforces the connection between productivity and human value. There is a real risk of more bullshit jobs being created under a job guarantee policy, and, if poorly implemented it could deny people the time to engage in other pursuits, whether care responsibilities or artistic endeavors. It has the potential to &lt;<em>p.194</em>&gt; leave behind people who cannot work, perhaps due to disability or other health concerns. There is something unavoidably didactic and potentially disciplinary about the concept. Frayne urges a focus on policies that do not “seek to enrol people in some pre-planned utopian scheme, but to gradually free them from prescribed roles, furnishing them with the time to become politically active citizens.” We should be wary of the prescriptive approaches to policy-making that underpin a job guarantee.</p>
<p>Still, the idea of a job guarantee is a useful one to consider. It hints at something important: the centralized organization of socially necessary work. The universality of the idea has other appealing qualities. It could be used as the basis for a right to certain kinds of universal leave, such as parental leave, sick leave and long service leave, transferable between employers. Anyone who works and meets the minimum requirements of a job under the guarantee could be paid these entitlements out of a publicly managed fund collected from employers, for example. It creates the prospect of collective decisions about production that are not based on profit but on human need, environmental sustainability and dignity in work.</p>
<p>To be liberating, rather than enforcing a paradigm of work-for-welfare, a job guarantee must allow for flexible and expansive definitions of work that satisfy the requirements for inclusion in the scheme. The working hours should be fewer than the current average working week. It should aim to organize socially necessary work and distribute it among the population able to carry it out. It might start to look like the world Bertrand Russell imagined when he argued for a four-hour day, in which the work “will be enough to make leisure delightful, but not enough to produce exhaustion.” In short, it ought to look a little more like a basic income for socially necessary work.</p>
<p>As part of this mix, we also need to consider the role of service provision, since neither a basic income nor a job guarantee necessarily provide for this. This idea has been called “universal basic services,” that is, the provision of health, education, housing, public transport, connectivity and personal care services to everyone, free at the point &lt;<em>p.195</em>&gt; of service. Rather than focusing on a monetary or financial method of redistribution, it represents a shift to a service-orientated model designed to meet the needs of people more directly. This approach to welfare provision acts as a counterpoint to the idea that a basic income replaces these systems of welfare. It also ensures that anyone who might not be able to perform socially necessary work is cared for properly. The stigma associated with welfare services is reduced, as everyone pays into and receives the benefits of social insurance.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we need a combination of these programs. We need the liberty offered by a basic income, the sustainability promised by the organization of a job guarantee, and the protection of dignity offered by centrally planned essential services. It is like a New Deal for the age of automation, a ground rent for the digital revolution, in which the benefits of accelerated productive capacity are shared among everyone. From each according to their ability, to each according to their need–a twenty-first-century vision of socialism. “We have it in our power to begin the world over again,” wrote Thomas Paine in an appendix to <em>Common Sense</em>, just before one of the most revolutionary periods in human history. We have a similar opportunity today.</p>
