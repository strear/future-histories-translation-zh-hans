<p>Conclusion:</p>
<h1 id="history-is-for-the-future">History Is for the Future</h1>
<h2 id="another-world-is-on-its-way">Another World Is on Its Way</h2>
<p>&lt;<em>p.261</em>&gt; “There’s a time when the operation of the machine becomes so odious, makes you so sick at heart, that you can’t take part,” declared the student radical Mario Savio in 1964 on the steps of Sproul Hall, at the University of California at Berkeley:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And you’ve got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels … upon the levers, upon all the apparatus, and you’ve got to make it stop. And you’ve got to indicate to the people who run it, to the people who own it, that unless you’re free, the machine will be prevented from working at all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are facing a future in which some of the best technological developments are made in relation to warfare or commerce rather than freedom and empowerment. Digital technology has become a machinery for producing billionaires rather than lives of dignity for the billions. While many of the decisions made by the elite of technology capitalism are made in California, the effects are felt all around the world, from the factories of Shenzhen to the mines of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the streets of London and the train stations of New Delhi. The machinery of the digital age is &lt;<em>p.262</em>&gt; designed not by us but for us—which is a source of oppression but also a source of power.</p>
<p>Digital technology, for all its scope to watch us, think for us and automate our jobs, is still reliant on us to operate. It is not a mysterious or unexplained apparatus; it creates places that both shape us and can be shaped by us; it is created by people, it is guided by decisions made by people, it is owned by people. People can also stop it from working. We have the opportunity to reclaim the power of technology, to appropriate the machinery and use its gears, wheels and levers, its silicon and glass, and repurpose it for the good of the many rather than the few.</p>
<p>Devising a usable past for digital technology endows it with tradition in an age dominated by ephemera, provides a set of theories for understanding confected realities, a history for a world obsessively chasing the future. It creates a possibility of common cause for an atomized society.</p>
<p>We need yardsticks to assess technological developments and comparisons that help put them in historical context. As technology enters more of the private spaces where we define our sense of self, we should ask whether such incursions are manipulative or facilitate digital self-determination. We should consider how advances in technology do or do not redistribute wealth and the extent to which this allows for the creation of a commons to drive further innovation. As we continue to build the technological and legal infrastructure of our online lives, we should ensure that there are ways for deliberating these developments collectively, for navigating how we protect autonomy, while also maintaining accountability. Our progress should be measured by our capacity to protect our digital environment, and we must think outside of traditional models of governance to achieve this. We should be nurturing collaborative forms of production and the unfettered use of our collective knowledge. Like the radical thinkers and activists that populate our usable past, I want us to challenge the centralization of power under capitalism toward the ruling class and their backers in government.</p>
<p>Technology alone will never solve our problems. But political &lt;<em>p.263</em>&gt; activism, informed by theory and history, can push for technological development to serve people rather than profit. Digital activists cannot carry out this work alone. They need to work collaboratively with those struggling for justice in other fields. We need them in social movements and organizations, working with fellow activists to design technologies and laws based on radical and democratic principles. Participants in social movements across the spectrum of progressive politics cannot be expected to understand the minutiae of technological design agendas, but they should know who to ask. They must engage with the more general political conundrums posed by digital technology, because we all have a stake in the outcome. The people who make technology need feedback from users so their work can be informed by a broad range of human experiences and serve the public effectively. Together we can mobilize society’s technological sophistication to dismantle capitalism and recreate representative structures that are genuinely democratic. We have the capacity to create communal luxury, but we will have to work collaboratively to make it happen.</p>
<p>Our priority must be to build bridges between people with interests in technology, politics, history, data science, art and activism. There is no denying that grave challenges lie ahead. But it is possible to imagine a future defined by fairness, empowerment and collective joy. Harnessing the promise of digital technology for a public commons makes this more possible than ever. It will be a future of beautiful automatons, curious flâneurs, robots that eat the rich, and socialized cows—wandering freely in our imaginations and our cyberspace.</p>
