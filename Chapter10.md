# The Digital World Is an Environment That Needs to Be Cared For

## Ancient Forms of Governance Hold Relevance for Modern Infrastructure

<*p.217*> The Māori *iwi* of Whanganui, in the North Island of New Zealand, fought for the recognition of their ancestor for nearly 150 years. But that ancestor is not a person or a name or a family. It is the Whanganui River, the third-largest in the country. As part of a settlement under law in 2017, the river was recognized as a legal person, meaning it had the rights and liabilities that derive from that status. "From our perspective treating the river as a living entity is the correct way to approach it, as in indivisible whole," said the lead negotiator for the iwi (or tribe), Gerrard Albert, "instead of the traditional model for the last 100 years of treating it from a perspective of ownership and management."

The Whanganui case was not the first settlement of this kind. In 2012, the Tūhoe negotiated a similar arrangement over their lands in Te Urewera National Park. As well as financial redress from the New Zealand government, the Tūhoe steadfastly sought autonomy over the lands. They were not looking for rights or concessions but self-governance. There are also precedents for this kind of legal status in other parts of the world. The Colombian Supreme Court <*p.218*> of Justice declared in 2018 that parts of the Amazon possessed legal rights to protection.

The Māori approach to land is deeply distinctive from Western conceptions of ownership. They do not view the natural environment as a resource to be exploited, but understand human beings as just one part of the universe, living together with land, rivers and sea. For the Tūhoe, this affinity takes the literal form of kinship---one of their ancestors was the offspring of a union between mountain and mist. Everything about the Tūhoe is "entangled in this place we call Te Urewera," explained the chief negotiator, Tamati Kruger.

Treating a river or tract of land as a person may seem curious at first, but Western legal systems too assign personhood to a variety of things. If companies and trusts can be legal persons, it is not difficult to imagine granting similar status to a river, especially given the importance of a healthy environment for our own physical well-being. But it remains novel legal territory in Western law. The Tūhoe settlement was the first of its kind, and the Whanganui settlement represented an end to the longest-running litigation in New Zealand's history. But even though these cases took a many years, the Māori position remained steadfast. As the representative for the local area of the Whanganui, Adrian Rurawhe, put it: "It's not that we've changed our worldview, but people are catching up to seeing things the way that we see them."

Indigenous communities, including the Māori and equivalent populations in Australia and Canada, have a lot to teach us about governance and the natural world. While there are certainly differences across these peoples, there are also commonalities. Colonial projects across the globe were consistently intent on eradicating these approaches and replacing them with their own. To put it in more positive terms, these societies had sophisticated systems of law prior to colonization, though they are rarely afforded the respect they deserve in mainstream histories. In his fascinating examination of the precolonial Aboriginal Australian economy and society, Bruce Pascoe makes an urgent call for an examination of what he claims to be "the longest lasting pan-continental stability the world has ever <*p.219*> known," to learn how "that cooperation was wrought without resort to the physical coercion and war common in other civilisations." Melissa Lucashenko, an Australian Aboriginal woman, argues persuasively that "there is overwhelming evidence from Aboriginal oral history, as well as from anthropology and written history, that Aboriginal adults traditionally saw the world in highly egalitarian terms compared to their European contemporaries." For thousands of years prior to colonization, she argues, they negotiated a "structured peace" across vast territories and multiple language groups. She concludes: "If that isn't a democratic outlook, it's hard to know just what is."

There are real questions about the extent to which Aboriginal laws and customary practices can be meaningfully or effectively synthesized with dominant Western legal systems. The thinking about Aboriginal governance and decolonization is understandably diverse, and there are complexities around the language of sovereignty and self-determination that often reflect disagreements on how power is exercised through law and politics. My object here is not to resolve these questions or to suggest that the thinkers cited here are congruent or even aligned, but rather to uphold these ideas as points of discussion that might helpfully inform our approach to the governance of collective resources.

In the preceding chapter, we saw how Fanon reckoned with personal identity under colonialism. According to Tamati Kruger, the Tūhoe have their own definition of this idea, which he expresses poetically: "*Mana motuhake* [self-government/determination] is the ability to live your own dreams, rather than being forced to live the dreams of others." This profound idea evokes more than an individual pursuit, focused on a sense of self: decolonization has a broader history and practice that regularly plays out in Indigenous communities around the world fighting for their land. Fanon's warning about Europe, and the need to avoid reproducing that society in Africa, is constantly finding new forms of expression in places that are coming to grips with the legacy of colonialism. Stories like that of the Whanganui River and the Tūhoe show how former colonies can grapple <*p.220*> with their past in ways that are inclusive and constructive. Indigenous ideas of governance are not historical relics or anomalies; they hold valuable knowledge for how we can move forward in modern society, with relevance to various problems arising in the course of the digital revolution.

A Mohawk writer and professor from Canada, Taiaiake Alfred has analyzed how the "conquest mentality" created a structure of relationships between people and the land "that is ultimately destructive to everyone and everything involved." Understanding and appreciating Indigenous approaches to governance is an important task, not just as part of an attempt to right historical wrongs or as a way of coming to terms with the cultural significance of land. Rather, Alfred believes, it is necessary to save the world from the logic and drive of capitalist development, which is lacking an ethical framework or principles of sustainability. Unlike capitalism, Indigenous concepts of governance explicitly place limits on the ideas of growth and exploitation. The Australian Aboriginal scholar Irene Watson explains things another way: "We live as a part of the natural world; we are in the natural world. The natural world is us," she writes. "We take no more from the environment than is necessary to sustain life ... Settler societies have lived on Nunga [First Peoples'] lands and taken more than is needed to sustain life and the result, as we know, is the depletion of *ruwe* [the territories of First Nations People] and the exhaustion of natural resources." Unless something changes, we can expect a climate apocalypse with devastating consequences.

These principles have relevance to how we discuss the regulation of collective digital spaces. This is not a bid to appropriate these ideas but rather to argue that we have much to learn from how these societies maintained peace with each other in the context of managing shared resources. It is an attempt to avoid assuming the centrality of European traditions of law and governance, and to admit how these assumptions have crowded out other perspectives. As Watson puts it, "very few ever consider asking the question: what laws existed before colonization or, what happened to those <*p.221*> systems of law?" When we ask this question, we start to think about how First Nations' laws hold "the potential for the future growing up of humanity." Relatedly, we can also draw from more recent movements for environmental protection to build on their strengths and anticipate their weaknesses. The Internet is a resource---both a history and a future---that we ought to hold in common. It crosses national borders and provides collective value and wisdom. It demonstrates the power and value of interconnectedness and interdependence. But it is also vulnerable to exploitation and the insidious consequences of privatization. It is an environment that needs to be cared for.

It is also the environment in which we increasingly live. The environment is relevant to the broader purpose of this book in two ways. First, it serves as an analogy. Like the natural environment, the digital network is a shared infrastructure that we all utilize, and how it is governed will have implications for how we relate to each other socially. If we think of the Internet as something physical that must be regulated and protected in the material world, there is a lot to learn from the history of environmentalism and the way in which Indigenous communities relate to land in places like New Zealand, Australia and Canada. By regulating the network in ways these communities value, with fairness and respect, we can avoid this common resource being used to accumulate wealth for a minority---which, in the environmental context, is giving rise to devastating climate change.

There are limits to the environmental analogy: most obviously, the digital network does not hold spiritual significance in the way that the land and environment does for Indigenous people. Digital infrastructure is a human creation. The analogy is not aimed at belittling this in any way but, as with other chapters in this book, draws inspiration from alternative relationships to the physical world and its shared resources. As Alfred points out: "Scholars of international law are now beginning to see the vast potential for peace represented in indigenous political philosophies." Scholars of the digital society would be well advised to do the same.

<*p.222*> Second, there is a more consequential relevance: our capacity to address climate change is linked to the extent to which we can make the most of the digital revolution. Digital technology has the potential to maximize our use of limited material resources in all sorts of ways, including in relation to food supply, energy production and resource management. Insofar as we are learning from the frightening prospect of catastrophic climate change, we might apply that learning to how we approach governance of the Internet. Peter Frase talks about this in *Four Futures* (2016), which he frames around the twin anxieties of ecological disaster and the automation of work. These two issues, he argues, are "fundamentally about inequality":

> They are about the distribution of scarcity and abundance, about who will pay the costs of ecological damage and who will enjoy the benefits of a highly productive, automated economy. There are ways to reckon with the human impact on the Earth's climate, and there are ways to ensure that automation brings material prosperity for all rather than impoverishment and desperation for most. But those possible futures will require a very different kind of economic system than the one that became globally dominant by the late twentieth century.

How we discuss and make decisions about the digital society has urgent relevance for our ecological future. We can no longer postpone the task of managing our resources differently from the status quo.

Tamati Kruger recalls a moment in the negotiations between the Tūhoe and the New Zealand government when talks broke down. He realized that the prime minister then, John Key, had misunderstood what the Tūhoe were seeking:

> Ownership was his obsession, not ours. So now we don't use that word. It's not a Tūhoe concept anyway. In the course of these negotiations, I've had to study this European understanding of that word "ownership" and <*p.223*> where it came from. Ownership is the proof that something is yours to sell. So it is more about how to rid yourself of something, to gain material benefit from it, than to preserve and keep it.

Alfred echoes this sentiment, noting that "sovereignty" is an inappropriate political objective, as it is based on an idea of dominance and rights, buying into the colonial mentality. His aim is to rebuild cultures of mutual respect, both for each other and our surroundings, drawing on the work of Indigenous activists dedicated to bringing these cultures to the fore. "Our goal should be to convince others of the wisdom of the indigenous perspective." In the twenty-first century, we need to create a digital environment that is not owned by anyone or any entity but is preserved and protected for a shared future, based on a culture of mutual respect. We need to start thinking about the Internet as a landscape that creates the conditions in which we live, as a shared responsibility that we contribute to and draw from.

Trevor Paglen photographs invisible things. Better said, his interest lies in the point at which the invisible becomes visible, where the imagined becomes material. Paglen has spoken about how we often use a range of mystifying metaphors to describe the Internet, when not trotting out hopelessly clichéd images of digits and light, like a bad version of the Matrix. From the perspective of intelligence agencies or service providers, however, the Internet looks rather different. It is an infrastructure, made up of cables, nodes and choke points. Major continents are strung together across seas and oceans. Fiber optic cables fuse cities across land. Maps of this infrastructure plot out how we communicate. Its components are all owned and controlled by specific groups of people. This sense of ownership---together with the right to gain material benefit from it, as Kruger might put it---is something we often forget when we picture the Internet.

Paglen's photos include a collection of underwater scenes, murky and unremarkable, save for a cable running through them. This is <*p.224*> the Internet in concrete form. It is shocking to see something so essential to our lives today looking rather paltry in a dreary vista of the ocean floor. The cables are surprisingly slim, seemingly quite vulnerable. Yet much of our daily traffic of human knowledge, life-giving infrastructure and communication travels at the speed of light down the spines of these dismal sea snakes. Just as the health of the Whanganui River is connected to human vitality, these cables are critical to our systems of food and energy production, knowledge, personal safety and cultural heritage. How this system is governed has an impact on our individual and collective health and well-being.

Paglen's photos encourage us to think of the Internet as connected objects rather than a service or a space or some more fanciful metaphor (perhaps most notoriously, yet quite accurately, "tubes"). They help us appreciate the hard truths of geography as applied to the Internet. They force us to consider how our digital society exists in material terms, and how it is governed. These cables did not come from nowhere; they were laid and are controlled by people. As professor Philip N. Howard puts it, this physical reality reflects a political world order---what he calls *pax technica*---a pact between big technology firms and government:

> Undersea trunk cables connect continents. Private businesses own and maintain those cables. Those businesses have lobbyists who try to acquire bigger and bigger contracts from governments. A simple way to describe this relationship is to say that politicians made investments in surveillance firms, and surveillance firms made investments in politicians.

The chief material beneficiaries of the Internet are businesses, keen to promote commerce using digital technology, and those who run the surveillance state. This *pax technica* is a political idea that takes physical form in these cables, but all too often it remains obscured from view and therefore easy to forget.

If we dive a little deeper, the history of the Internet backbone tells us how its physical reality has been shaped by the interests of private <*p.225*> industry and government, but also that it need not have been this way. The pipes and switches that connect us today were originally built with public funds, for public use. It was a political decision to hand them over to commercial entities, which in turn comply with the demands of the surveillance state.

How did this happen? In the early days of networked computing just after World War Two, various people and organizations started to see the value of connecting large computers. A number of different networks developed over this time, both publicly funded (through the US military) and commercial equivalents. The first and most important network was not built by business or government but---appropriately---by a collective. Michigan State University, Wayne State University and the University of Michigan together conceived the Merit network as a method for communicating between themselves for research purposes. It turned out they were really good at it.

The Merit network received some initial funding in the late 1960s from the Michigan state legislature and the National Science Foundation (NSF), an independent federal agency to promote the progress of science, improve national health, prosperity, and welfare, and secure the nation's defense. Merit was one of several similar projects the NSF had under way, including ones dedicated to expanding networks and building national infrastructure that could eventually roll out country-wide access to the Internet for everyone. Throughout the early 1980s, the NSF built connections between five funded supercomputer centers and a high-speed backbone that connected over 200 regional and campus networks. Together this was known as the National Science Foundation Network (NSFNET) or the Internet backbone.

Eventually, as traffic and users increased, maintaining the Internet backbone became too much for the NSF, and it solicited assistance for managing this national network in 1987. Merit was up to the task and won the bid. Indeed, against the prevailing expectations of universities, as compared to commercial or military operations, it performed exceedingly well. Merit ran the NSFNET for seven and a <*p.226*> half years, during which time, according to a former president of the organization, Eric M. Aupperle,

> backbone network traffic increased nearly a thousandfold, reaching almost 100 billion packets per month. The number of Internet networks announced on the backbone grew from a handful in 1988 to 50,766 in April 1995, of which 22,296 were non-US networks. The number of countries comprising the Internet grew from 3 to 93. The extraordinary success of the NSFNET project was the dominant factor in converting the ARPANET and early NSFNET research and academically focused Internet into today's worldwide commodity Internet phenomenon.

Aupperle concluded, just over a decade after the project ended: "Merit and our partners are proud and pleased to have been a key part of this exciting transition."

So why did this project come to an end if it was working so well? The answer is politics.

The NSFNET emerged at a time when large social investments were increasingly considered politically passé. The neoliberal agenda was gaining force on both sides of the mainstream partisan divide, with a renewed and vigorous faith that the market could deliver services better than the lumbering bureaucracies of government or public entities. The government's job, according to the growing consensus among the political class, was to regulate markets only minimally and allow the private sector to flourish, privatizing services that were previously considered the purview of public institutions. This was reflected in the approach taken to the Internet backbone. Commercial traffic was not permitted on the NSFNET. The idea was that this prohibition would create incentives for commercial networks to develop concurrently. This reflected a long-term plan for the network to be commercialized, and presumably expand, so that researchers would ultimately piggyback off an expanded commercial Internet.

Everything went exactly to plan. Commercial providers sprang up, and over the course of the next decade the US government <*p.227*> supervised the complete privatization of the Internet backbone network. There were no meaningful regulations imposed on the use and development of the Internet infrastructure. The NSFNET was eventually defunded.

This represented the privatization of a public infrastructure project, with consequences for our understanding of the collective. The government imposed a sense of ownership on something that was actually the subject of a common responsibility, and by the same token it disavowed a more social and relational approach to this piece of shared infrastructure. As Watson points out, "relational philosophy is embedded in Indigenous knowledge systems; knowledge belongs to a people and the people belong to a landscape." This approach elevates a sense of responsibility that is lacking in the neoliberal agenda that seeks the privatization of public resources. "Indigenous knowledges, unlike those of Europe, carry obligations and responsibilities, such as custodial obligations to ruwe that bind future generations," writes Watson. When lawmakers sold off our digital infrastructure, they were motivated by a philosophy that presumes that market-based systems of property and profit are superior for our collective development. They short-changed us all.

The outcome of this has been an Internet that operates at a substandard level in the continental United States. Despite being the place where the Internet all began, the United States cannot match other developed nations on speed, coming in tenth on average. Most acutely, speeds in rural areas remain slow, with few firms in the private market competing over connections. According to the Federal Communications Commission, "many Americans still lack access to advanced, high-quality voice, data, graphics and video offerings, especially in rural areas and on Tribal lands." The wholesale privatization process effectively created an oligarchy: a select few companies were able to consolidate commercial advantages at the time of privatization and create barriers to meaningful competition. The fragmentation of the backbone created a situation where large providers cut deals to manage traffic across networks. These are unregulated, secret agreements, made without any accountability. <*p.228*> As a result, newcomers seeking to enter the market do not compete on a level playing field, and the position of established corporations has been effectively consolidated. Companies control how traffic flows through the tubes, with no oversight, standards or performance requirements imposed by the government.

It is deeply concerning that we do not even have a map of the Internet backbone produced by a public authority. Thankfully some academics shouldered this task, but it took a dozen of them four years to produce, painstakingly compiled from multiple sources. They concluded that this kind of mapping has strong potential to improve efficiency and robustness, protect against natural disasters, and guard against criminal attacks. But more generally, it is also essential to Internet governance. It is revealing that this resource had to be produced by academics rather than the industry or government.

This is an example of the accumulation of technological infrastructure by industry, discussed by Luis Suarez-Villa in his examination of the nature of capitalism and digital technology. "The rapid accumulation of public technological infrastructure during the second half of the twentieth century," writes Suarez-Villa, "subsidized the power of corporatism, allowing it to become more effective in extracting value out of new knowledge." Value in this context does not mean for society or humanity in general, only for business corporations.

In short: public funds paid for the invention and development of a key piece of infrastructure. Then, in line with neoliberal economic philosophy, the government decided to outsource this to the market for the purposes of scaling up, for no good reason. The government could have easily continued to fund the backbone and its entire regional expansion---an ambitious program for sure, but no more so than a national rail or road system, and, moreover, it was something it was already doing. There is every chance this would have resulted in a faster and more efficient network. Some of the best aspects of the Internet as a network, its capacity to connect people in conditions of openness and neutrality, without incorporating tools to control its users, stem from its nonproprietary origins in academic <*p.229*> institutions rather than corporations. At the very least, the privatization of NSFNET represented an opportunity to incorporate social concerns into the functioning of this critical piece of infrastructure. But all these opportunities were lost. No meaningful requirements were imposed on the industry, not even the right to produce a map of its existence---the government simply gave it all away, ideologically convinced that the market delivers services better than governments or public institutions. Our current reality flatly contradicts this.

That old chestnut about the value of the market needs to be jettisoned once and for all. As Ben Tarnoff notes, there was nothing inevitable about the privatization of the Internet backbone. "It reflected an ideological choice, not a technical necessity," he writes. "Instead of confronting critical issues of popular oversight and access, privatization precluded the possibility of putting the Internet on a more democratic path." Professor Howard has pointed out how technologists and venture capitalists "love comparing the current internet of things to the Wild West---lots of people doing crazy, creative things on the frontiers of computer science and engineering." The analogy is dismayingly apt, in fact: just as the "frontier" in American history was based on the dispossession of Indigenous people for private gain, so too the great privatization of the Internet backbone represented depriving people from access to knowledge, community and empowerment in the interests of a select few.

As part of her analysis of Aboriginal law, Watson recounts the story of the greedy frog:

> The frog story tells of a time when a giant frog drank up the water until the land was all dried up and in drought. To survive, the collective of animals agreed it was necessary for the frog to release the water it had drunk back on to the land. They decided that the strategy most likely to succeed was to make the frog laugh; by laughing the frog would release the water. After many attempts at humouring the giant frog, the animals succeeded and the frog let forth a large laugh and with it released the water back on to the dry lands, filling up lakes, creeks and riverbeds. As a future precaution, the animals then decided that they would prevent the <*p.230*> event occurring again by reducing the power of the frog. So, instead of there being one giant frog, many smaller frogs were created and the frog was never again in a position of power to monopolise the land's waters.

The story highlights the dangers of the centralization of power, especially when it governs the distribution of life-giving resources. We could apply the lessons of this story to our thinking about the governance of digital infrastructure.

Some alternative ways to create an ecosystem of digital infrastructure focus on public ownership at a local level. In spite of the wholesale privatization of the Internet backbone, examples of public projects afford a glimpse of how things could have been done differently in the past, and how they might be done in the future.

Local government authorities across the United States have begun investing in digital infrastructure themselves, with surprisingly positive results. MuniNetworks.org, a project of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, has collated data on the more than 110 communities in twenty-four states with a publicly owned network offering at least one-gigabit-per-second services---twenty-six times faster than the national median. Chattanooga, Tennessee, is one example. An agency owned by the city, the Electric Power Board, has set up its own network with a government grant. The network offers higher speeds than any of its private-sector competitors, making Chattanooga the first city in the United States to have a citywide gigabit-per-second fiber Internet network at a reasonable price. Media reports note that "the city has established itself as a center for innovation---and an encouraging example for those frustrated with slow speeds and high costs from private broadband providers." Tarnoff reckons that these kindts of projects could be the first steps toward a "popular movement to reverse privatization."

Such initiatives are our future. Time is up on the era in which the Internet is owned by an oligarchy; the experiment with privatization, with "the impulses and the imperatives of capitalist development" as Alfred called it, must come to an end. We must demand the right see the pipes and switches of the Internet, to map its physical existence <*p.231*> so that we can plan how to expand and strengthen it, through good design and ambitious public investment. We must demand the right to take shared public responsibility for the Internet backbone and its tributaries, so that we can, in turn, take shared responsibility for own participation in digital society. The Internet backbone was a creation of public spending; the public has a claim over it. Governments should socialize the backbone, bring it under the collective authority of a democratically accountable authority, and allow autonomous local investment programs to deliver fast and efficient connectivity across the globe. To allow giant, greedy frogs to exist risks robbing us of a future in which we can share in abundant, essential resources collectively and responsibly.

It can be easy to dismiss these traditions of knowledge and rulemaking when they sit outside accepted paradigms. But we risk missing important insights and foreclosing alternative possibilities when we take for granted that our current approach is universal. How can we find common ground with people from diverse traditions---with alternative ways of speaking, knowing and determining identity---without overriding difference? This is a critical question in the digital age, when forms of representation are increasingly applied to everyone.

Taiaiake Alfred argues that "the primary goals of an indigenous economy are the sustainability of the earth and ensuring the health and well-being of the people." The Indigenous relationship with land, contrary to the settler project, is one of partnership. This means that differences of perspective are recognized rather than ignored or overruled. Indigenous philosophical alternatives are based on values such as a "wish to preserve a regime that honors the autonomy of individual conscience, non-coercive forms of authority, and a deep respect and interconnection between human beings and the other elements of creation." As a result, Indigenous conceptions of politics resist homogenization. They "explicitly allow for difference while mandating the construction of sound relationships among autonomously powered elements." Western ideas of statehood are <*p.232*> almost the opposite: rather than generating respect organically, from the bottom up, they "create a political or legal hegemony to guarantee respect." But this cannot last, says Alfred. "It is no longer possible to maintain the legitimacy of the premise that there is only one right way to see and do things."

What might this kind of equality, or respect for difference, look like in a digital society? When we discussed the idea of universal access to the digital network in chapters 7 and 8, it was framed around equality in the public spaces and platforms that facilitate democratic decision-making. It was a question of enfranchisement within systems of power, including political bodies and workplaces. But this universality is no excuse to flatten difference. Once we have equality of access to democracy in economic and public life, we need to think about respecting difference, allowing this to constitute a foundation for sustainable prosperity rather than the seeds of division. This will require that we pay specific attention to the building blocks of digital society, to turn our minds to some of the layers of the Internet above the pipe and switches, to take steps to ensure they enshrine respect for difference rather than entrench discrimination.

For example, neural networks will need to be trained in ways that explicitly acknowledge and address the problem of bias and allow space for divergence, conflicts and nuance. Word-embedding models illustrate the importance of this. These models operate by feeding huge amounts of text into a computer for the purposes of learning how words relate to each other in space. This is based on the premise that words that appear near one another within texts share a semantic meaning. These spatial relationships (or vectors) are used in natural language processing, teaching computers how to engage with us in human language. Word-embedding models are used all the time in many basic computer processes, the most obvious being the keyword search.

One way to demonstrate their functionality is by asking the model how words are associated with each other by analogy. For example, by reading a lot of text, a computer can learn that "Paris is to France" as "Tokyo is to Japan." The computer develops its own <*p.233*> kind of dictionary by association, and words can be associated with one another in varying degrees of strength.

But this can create problems when the world is not as it ought to be---when the sense of universality undermines certain particularities. For example, researchers have experimented with one of these word-embedding models, word2vec, a popular and freely available model trained on 3 million words from Google News texts. They found that it produces highly gendered analogies. For example, analogies produced by the model for "man is to woman" include "computer programmer is to homemaker." Or "father is to mother" as "doctor is to nurse." This is not surprising on one level, as men are overrepresented in the ranks of computer programmers, and women are more likely to be nurses than doctors. But it also objectively reflects a bias that will be reproduced when we engage with the computer using natural language that relies on word2vec. It is not hard to see how this model could also be racially biased or internalize forms of bigotry toward other groups. Programming around natural language involves a huge amount of complexity. For example, neutral words are often associated with men (such as actor) and words associated with women often require an adjective to neutralize them (such as male nurse). Then there are metaphors and sayings (grandfathering a provision, keeping mum) that use gendered terms. It turns out that mapping language is messy and perpetuates all sorts of biases that are not always obvious.

The research found that these biases not only exist in the corpus that trains the model (the Google News text), they can be amplified during the process of language learning when using the word-embedding model. As the *MIT Technology Review* points out: "if the phrase 'computer programmer' is more closely associated with men than women, then a search for the term 'computer programmer CVs' might rank men more highly than women." When this kind of language learning is used in medicine, education, employment, policy-making and criminal justice, for example, it is not hard to see how much damage these kinds of biases can cause. Researchers on other projects have also encountered this problem in photo data. <*p.234*> Two image collections used in research projects were shown to have some troubling gender biases: "Images of shopping and washing are linked to women, for example, while coaching and shooting are tied to men."

This kind of problem is not unlike other biased algorithms we have discussed in this book, including Latanya Sweeney's personal encounter with her non-criminal record and the mistaken labeling of the Al Jazeera bureau chief as a terrorist by the NSA. Natural language or image processing is still in essence an algorithm, and the logic used to arrive at conclusions is created and refined by humans. In some ways it is more insidious, because the failures are difficult to detect---there is something deeply alien about how computers learn language, completely different to how we do it as humans, meaning the errors can be disconcertingly unexpected and easily missed.

But there is something else distinctive of natural language: all language is a metaphor; it involves a symbol that replaces the real. This is not a problem of "garbage in, garbage out," as it can be with other algorithms, because there is no alternative to language, no superior base of evidence or data to feed into neural networks. The language is reflecting the world as it is, and it is not the place many of us hoped it would be. Do we use language to seek to understand the world as it is (more women are in fact nurses) or how it ought to be (nursing should be a vocation free of gender stigma or association)?

There are other examples of engineered processes that flatten difference. Miriam Posner has spoken about this as part of her work in the digital humanities. She raises examples like mapping. The ever-popular Google Maps entrenches the Cartesian model of picturing space and sidelines other approaches, including those from Indigenous societies. Models for collecting and using data simplify concepts like race, disguising its nature as a socially constructed and ongoing process of self-definition. "Common types of data visualization," Posner contends, "are great for quickly conveying known quantities but terrible at conveying uncertainty or conflicting opinions." Adam Greenfield has cautioned against the tendency to assume that digital maps are "objective accounts of the environment." The <*p.235*> reality, Greenfield argues, is that they are no such thing: "Our sense of the world is subtly conditioned by information that is presented to us for interested reasons, and yet does not disclose that interest." This is perhaps most obvious when observing how advertising helps to organize mapping technology on apps like Google Maps. But the program designers, for example, have also renamed whole suburbs in places such as Detroit and San Francisco, exercising this power without any meaningful accountability or transparency. It is unclear whether this is intentional or a function of the software design. The same problems arguably exist for almost any algorithmically determined form of representation.

These are layers of our digital infrastructure that have the potential to import inequalities and flatten difference unless we make the effort to identify and address them. We need to find ways to build into our computerized processes more space for nuance and conflict, more ways to define and respect difference, discarding the premise that there is only one right way to see and do things. We need to understand that the world is complex and diverse and draw on alternative approaches to how knowledge can be gathered and used---and this should inform how we represent it in digital settings. Computers and data can tell us how the world is, but we should use that learning to have a meaningful discussion about how it ought to be.

Professor Ben Schmidt offers some insights along these lines in his study of gender dynamics as they manifest in websites that collate reviews of professors. Analyzing this text using the word2vec mode, he draws an assortment of fascinating but curiously unsurprising conclusions regarding how people speak about male and female professors. Such as: "Students have a far more elaborate vocabulary to criticize women for being 'unprofessorial' than to criticize men." Or equally: "Students complain about the work their female professors assign: [not] because they have some other word for male workloads, but just because the workloads in woman-taught classes seem more worthy of comment." Schmidt points out that these kinds of programs do certain things, and we should be careful about <*p.236*> ascribing to them qualities they do not possess. In a reversal of the classic quote from Marx, when it comes to word embedding, he says, "the point is not to change the world, in various ways, but to understand it." Word-embedding models allow us to appreciate the nuanced ways in which language influences our thinking, and enrich our understanding of the deep and complex ways in which gender (and presumably other forms of social categorization) influences how we engage with the world.

We need to embrace this possibility for understanding, so it can create meaningful ways of addressing bias and incorporating difference. Digital technology offers myriad ways to collect these understandings and put them to work. We can address the gender biases inherent in language and picked up by word-embedding models, and the researchers critiquing word2vec have suggestions in this respect. We can also build alternative ways of representing space, as well as lived experience on all sorts of online platforms.

In 1769, while visiting Tahiti, Captain James Cook met a man called Tupaia, from Ra'iatea in the Pacific Islands. Tupaia was a senior man and an expert navigator who ended up joining the crew of Cook's ship, the *Endeavour*. During his time aboard, Tupaia strove to communicate to the crew what he knew about the enormous space of Polynesia, a history passed down through generations. Communicating this knowledge was a weighty task: the settlement of Polynesia, spanning Hawai'i, Aotearoa (New Zealand) and Rapa Nui (Easter Island) was the last great premodern migration. In his history of GPS, *Pinpoint*, Greg Milner argued that "it s hard to overstate the immensity of this accomplishment." It remained something of a mystery as to how it was achieved, even to the expert navigator Captain Cook.

Tupaia crafted a map that encompassed Tonga, Samoa and New Zealand. In it he demonstrated how Polynesians, using astronomy and seasonal winds, achieved navigational feats that were beyond his captain's imaginings. Yet Cook appeared to miss the importance of this document in dispelling the mystery of how Polynesia was settled. Over time, Tupaia became alienated from the crew and died <*p.237*> in 1770. The crew had found him to be "proud and austere," a social affront in racial terms. Cook himself seemed to find Tupaia disagreeable for failing to conform to the deferential posture expected of nonwhite people at the time. The historian Dan O'Sullivan suggests that Tupaia's self-confidence may have extended to geographical matters, "a cardinal sin" on an eighteenth-century ship. This disrespect for alternative perspectives meant that the complexities of Tupaia's knowledge were grossly underestimated and all but lost.

What other forms of knowledge have we lost as a result of privileging specific forms or representations? When everything is mapped by Google in a Cartesian framework, what nuances and alternative possibilities are excluded from our understanding of the world? Digital technology has the potential to accelerate our appreciation of alternative perspectives, but it requires an openness to and respect for diversity. Posner suggests we work toward "the thrill in capturing people's lived experience in radical ways, ways that are productive and generative and probably angry, too." She points out that this includes, for example, Aboriginal forms of picturing space using song lines rather than grids. The possibilities are endless, so long as we first agree that such biases exist and must be addressed by respecting positions of difference rather than glossing over them.

Just as it is for the climate, protection of the digital network is now essential for all sorts of everyday activities. Like the natural environment, it is a place of knowledge, enjoyment and self-exploration rather than just a resource for exploitation. The Internet was seed-funded through public money. It is the backbone of a huge amount of collaborative human effort and some of the most exciting developments in multiple fields of human endeavor. It should be returned to the domain of public ownership, through socialization and investment of public funds. It ought to be governed by rules agreed on transparently and in the interests of all users. Responsibility or accountability in the Indigenous sense, writes Alfred, involves a "requirement for universal inclusion and the maintenance of strong links between those charged with the responsibility of <*p.238*> decision-making and those who will have to live with the consequences of their decisions." We need to learn from Indigenous approaches to governance that prioritize respect and collective responsibility, and apply these millennia-old lessons to twenty-first-century movements for digital democracy.
