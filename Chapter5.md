Chapter 5:

# Technological Utopianism Is Dangerous

## The Tech Billionaires Have Nothing on the Paris Commune

<*p.95*> Julian West lay down to sleep in his Boston home on the evening of May 31, 1887. He customarily slept in a sealed chamber, a soundproof cellar below his house, in an effort to address his chronic insomnia. To assist him in falling asleep, West also hired the services of an alternative therapist. "I called in Dr. Pillsbury, [who] called himself a 'Professor of Animal Magnetism,'" explained West. "I don't think he knew anything about medicine, but he was certainly a remarkable mesmerist."

He was indeed. As a result of a fire that destroyed West's house that night, and a particularly profound form of mesmerizing animal magnetism, the insomniac awoke on the afternoon of September 10, 2000---113 years later. He was discovered by the new owner of his house while excavating the back garden, prior to building a subterranean laboratory. The new owner explained to West that he was now in what had been the distant future.

West remained unconvinced of this passage of time, and it was only when his host showed him the skyline of modern Boston that he began to realize his predicament. "Every quarter contained large open squares filled with trees, among which statues glistened and fountains flashed in the late afternoon sun. Public buildings of a colossal size and an architectural grandeur unparalleled in my day <*p.96*> raised their stately piles on every side," he recalled. "I knew then that I had been told the truth concerning the prodigious thing which had befallen me." West spent the remainder of his life exploring this wonderland of a future, with its advanced industrial organization and domestic automation ensuring a bountiful existence for all citizens, the product of technological development.

This may seem like an overly elaborate set-up to a novel, but it was one of the most popular fictions of its day. Published in 1887, Edward Bellamy's *Looking Backward* was arguably "the most widely read and influential utopian tract of all time" and inspired "Bellamy clubs" across the country. The idea of a utopian future in which the problems of the present were miraculously resolved and society was organized efficiently and fairly captured the fancy of a whole generation.

Imagining a better world has occupied humans for millennia. It is a powerful elixir, the idea of a society of stability and sufficiency; it can be a source of motivation to strive for something better, as well as a method for highlighting the shortcomings of the present. Utopianism is the practice of taking these imaginings to extremes, applying innovative and creative ways of thinking to work out the logistics of a future perfect society. But problems arise because these visions of the future are often detached in causal terms from the troubles of the present. Utopians prefer taking imaginary shortcuts to a new world, like Bellamy's protagonist's overly long nap, offering little guidance about how to actually get there. The Boston in which West awakens feels vigorous and modern, a society motivated by equality and respect, powered by futuristic technology. Though Bellamy never identified it as such, it was commonly understood as a form of utopian socialism. But while we are free to imagine this perfect society, we remain fettered by its impossibility. If this kind of thinking creates a yardstick by which to measure our progress and an ideal to aim toward, it also renders our imaginations a salve rather than a cure.

Bellamy's novel was exciting because it reframed basic assumptions about the intractability of human misery. "It is a mystery," <*p.97*> muses the host from modern Boston, Dr. Leete, reflecting on the past West used to inhabit, "how men with children could favor a system under which they were rewarded beyond those less endowed with bodily strength or mental power." Bellamy's future was one of universal sharing and industriousness, and such images have a moral weight. But the method of arriving at this destination remained persistently obscure throughout the novel. "All that society had to do was to recognize and cooperate with [industrial] evolution," explains Dr. Leete, with little further detail. Technological optimization, it seems, was Bellamy's pathway to utopia. The assumption has had a long legacy.

There is another tendency running through some forms of utopianism that can also serve the darker purpose of obfuscation. The idea that these imaginary future societies are actually detached from the present is often, ironically, an illusion. Without a proper understanding of the nature of the problems of the present, these visions for the future offer solutions that look remarkably similar in structure to the world they are trying to escape. Utopians often seek to beguile the problem of politics, to bypass negotiating the messy and complex networks of power relations between ruler and ruled. But in doing so, it is too easy to fall into the trap of reproducing the structures that give rise to current misery, with little more than a vacuous overlay of supposedly reasonable, enlightened thinking by those with already enough power to appoint themselves to the job of shaping such societies. Utopianism can abridge our capacity to imagine what true emancipation might look like.

In *Looking Backward*, for example, Bellamy paints a futuristic society made up of a "federal system of autonomous nations," each with its own "industrial army," that looks not unlike a benevolent version of state-run, monopolistic capitalism. It is never clear how this social and economic system avoids the problems that West had left behind in the previous century. If we fail to transform the structures that give rise to social and economic inequality, advances in all fields of human endeavor will remain beholden to these problems---and so too will the imagined solutions.

<*p.98*> The challenge is to use our imaginations without falling into undiscerning, insidious utopianism. Can we come up with an ideal society in our thoughts but one that also exists with reference to the present? Right around the time Bellamy was writing, Oscar Wilde made a forceful case against capitalism in his essay *The Soul of Man under Socialism* and expounded the vital importance of a world in which "poverty was impossible." In it, he was right to argue that "a map of the world that does not include Utopia is not worth even glancing at." But it is also worth remembering that a map of the world that includes Utopia must be grounded in some kind of material reality; it will offer a route for getting there.

Technological utopianism is a specific vision of the future. It sees technological progress as the means to bring about a perfect society. To this extent, technology serves as a remedy for human weakness, doing a range of jobs faster and better than we ever could, overcoming the limitations of the natural environment, and creating the foundations of a genuine meritocracy free from the chaos of human society. Its supporters believe that technology, developed to the extreme, or optimized, has the capacity to generate a virtuous society of abundance.

Utopianism has a long history. But the specific kind of thinking popularized in Bellamy's *Looking Backward* saw its heyday in America between the 1880s and the early 1930s. Technological utopians were living in times of labour unrest, arising from the grimy and at times brutal developments and after-effects of the industrial revolution. Their work illuminated some of the anxieties of their day and applied constructive thinking to how technology could address them. Their movement, insofar as it could be called one, shared certain values and tendencies. From a theoretical perspective, it seized upon what they saw as the most important contemporary trend in society---the development of technology---and attempted to predict the outcomes of its advance and spread.

The shared vision stitched together from these individual texts reveals several common threads. These men (as they all were) had <*p.99*> exciting hopes for the future; there is something precious about their optimistic exercises in fantasy.

The result is a set of imaginary worlds that look remarkably similar: highly organized, free from the filth and chaos of the industrial revolution, clean, efficient, and able to satisfy the needs of its inhabitants. Technology was shown to improve every aspect of human life---from production to housework, urban planning, and even the weather. How exactly this would happen was never fully explained, but it tended to involve large-scale machinery designed by engineers and tended to by workers. New inventions, such as personalized, compact electric motors, or glass with the strength and malleability of metal, facilitated the construction of vast and beautiful cityscapes and urban living spaces. Communal kitchens produced meals for everyone, punctually, without waste. Education was widely accessible; dangerous work was obsolete. The end of selfishness and monopolistic enterprise reduced inefficiencies and raised the living standards of the traditionally disenfranchised.

But while this was imaginative and innovative, there was also something of a conservative strain running through the ideas of technological utopians. Historian Howard P. Segal talks of how their writings often formed "a movement not of revolt but of antithesis---a movement seeking to alter the speed with which American society was moving but not the direction." They saw themselves not as creators of something new but as advocates for a progress already underway. Their writings resisted a sophisticated examination of the deficiencies of the present by conjuring a distinct and better future.

This left an unavoidable black hole in the logic of first-wave technological utopians. They argued that a future perfect society was a logical extension of the present---it could be generated by animating existing social trends---yet it was unclear how this might come about in practice. Very little is ever said about this point: the onset of utopia was typically skipped over as simply a logical outcome of technological advancement. To the extent the point was addressed, utopian writers described their ideal societies transpiring as a consequence of various vague factors that accelerated development, <*p.100*> such as greater intelligence among the masses, recognition of and cooperation with industrial evolution, the unstoppable expansion of corporations, and the transformative ability to manufacture power. In other words, technological utopia was understood as the natural progression of capitalist development.

Glossing over the intricacies of cause and effect is a convenient storytelling device, but it also reveals something deeper about this kind of thinking. It manifests a desire to avoid a proper reckoning with the causes of problems in the present and, as such, any clear theory about how they might be changed. For some technological utopians, like Bellamy, this took the form of a mostly benign escapism, which provided a rich and compelling portrait of an equitable world of human flourishing. While there was diversity in how they approached their narrative, the technological utopians writing in the decades after the industrial revolution displayed common tendencies and philosophical bents, and they sparked a movement of sorts focused on a brighter future. But whether unconsciously or by design, many of these utopian worlds had a way of echoing trends of inequality that existed in their own society. It was symptomatic of a certain form of political blindness.

Most obviously, this can be found in the set of social and political relations that complemented the utopian concept of economic order. For example, in many of the technological utopians' writings, those with a mastery of technology formed a new elite class, commanding respect and deference. In George S. Morison's book, *The New Epoch as Developed by the Manufacture of Power* (1903), engineers were literally revered:

> [the engineer] is the priest of material development, of the work which enables other men to enjoy the fruits of the great sources of power in nature, and of the power of mind over matter. He is the priest of the new epoch, a priest without superstitions.

The rest of society was obliged to toil on the machines these engineers created. In King Camp Gillette's manifesto *World Corporation* <*p.101*> (1924), humans became part of the machinery itself---"cogs in the machine, acting in response to the will of a corporate mind." Just as the capitalists dictated to workers in the industrial revolution, so too would engineers preside over a society that treated people as a kind of machinery.

This instrumental understanding of people entailed markedly ascetic views about free time. In *The Diothas* by John Macnie (1883), for example, people only worked up to three hours a day, yet inactivity was reproved: "If any live in idleness, it is evident that others must toil to support them. Time-honored custom, therefore, requires that all children, whether boys or girls, shall acquire some handicraft." In *Looking Backward*, neglect of work in the "industrial army" was punished with bread and water in solitary confinement. Similarly, despite labor-saving technology that meant that people need only work two hours a day, it was not a life of leisure in Henry Olerich's *A Cityless and Countryless World* (1893). "We teach that labour is necessary and honourable, that idleness is robbery and disgrace," declares the protagonist, a visitor to Earth from a utopian society on Mars. Workers were expected to devote any free time to self-improvement. Free time in utopia, it seems, was not actually free. This kind of attitude fits with the prevailing views at the turn of the century, when industriousness was highly valued and respected. (Indeed, Bertrand Russell penned an entire dissenting essay in 1932 called *In Praise of Idleness*, affirming that "there is far too much work done in the world, that immense harm is caused by the belief that work is virtuous.")

Given the obsession with efficiency and productivity as the path to self-actualization, self-control was the defining feature of intimate relationships in these technological utopias. Social interactions were definitively distant. Reproduction was often considered the sole purpose of sex, with licentiousness considered "unchaste" and "impure." Though basic forms of equality were recognized for women---in ways often far ahead of their time, and even ahead of our current state of affairs---family structures and sexual mores remained rigid. Though some technological utopians envisaged <*p.102*> lives of fierce social and political equality for women, the usual whiff of sexism often accompanied such visions. "It is their privilege," remarks the guide in *The Diothas* in reference to women, "to be beautiful, and in some measure, a social obligation to keep themselves so." Their job, in that particular utopia, was mainly housework. The reproduction of discriminatory attitudes to women in these imaginary societies would come as no surprise to many modern women, given it was mostly privileged men penning the words.

Technological utopians also cast off democracy; technical expertise was much more important for running a virtuous society. "Politics which we recognize as a necessary governmental part of our competitive, industrial system will have no place under the 'World Corporation,'" wrote Gillette. "There will be no voting, no political campaigns, and no favourites of fortune, either socially or industrially, except those who by study, application, perseverance, intelligence, and ability earn and by right attain positions in the World Corporate System." Voting was seen as a poor way to make decisions, especially when technology and technocrats could do it better. "Administration in a technocracy has to do with material factors which are subject to measurement," argued Harold Loeb in *Life in a Technocracy* (1933). "Therefore, popular voting can be largely dispensed with. It is stupid deciding an issue by a vote or opinion when a yardstick can be used." According to these writers, the optimization of technology would free society from the problem of politics, and social democracy would be superseded by more logical and cohesive organizing principles.

These utopias often put on display an imagined solution to unequal economic distribution and social disharmony that was just more of the same: more capitalism, technologically optimized. The entire premise of Gillette's utopia was that society be run as a giant corporation. He believed the industrial and political system was similar to a piece of machinery, which could be improved with the help of a scientific approach to design. To "complete the industrial evolution" wrote Gillette, the idea of a singular, enormous corporation "has power to join in harmony millions and millions of <*p.103*> individuals, and, where chaos reigned, order and system takes its place." The democratic organization of society stood in the way of advances being made by the corporate structure: "The most serious obstruction to material progress is our present Government and its political parties and machinery ... These same men would have been among the enraged mob who destroyed the looms in an English mill less than a hundred years ago."

The description of the "logical evolution" that society underwent in Bellamy's *Looking Backward* was almost identical to Gillette's idea of a single corporation:

> The nation ... organized as the one great business corporation in which all other corporations were absorbed; it became the one capitalist in the place of all other capitalists, the sole employer, the final monopoly in which all previous and lesser monopolies were swallowed up, a monopoly in the profits and economies of which all citizens shared.

In *A Cityless and Countryless World*, such monopolies are shunned, but utopia is still achieved via an extreme form of capitalism: "*free* competition, of *healthy* supply and demand" rather than substandard "monopolistic laws."

While these technological utopians showed dazzling imagination and an infectious enthusiasm for the future, they were also susceptible to some surprisingly conservative and unsavory ideas. In some cases, these intellectual shortcomings stemmed from an indifference to the social and political work that needed to be done to transform their visions into reality. In other cases, they derived from an uncritical embrace of capitalist economic and social relations, which inevitably influenced how technology developed. Often it was a mix of both. As capitalism escalates, and especially as technology develops, political, social and economic democracy necessarily decreases. This was a criticism that many of the technological utopians were unconcerned by, or unwilling to entertain. The result was that these various utopias were either appealing but unachievable, or achievable but not very appealing.

<*p.104*> Today these texts feel clunky and outdated. The movement, insofar as their shared vision and common popularity constituted one, dissipated. Segal argues that World War Two turned the idea of a utopia arising from technological development into a dystopia. There was a drift away from optimistic faith in technology after the Vietnam War; as the environmental damage associated with technology became clearer, the economy lost momentum and conservatism became ascendant throughout the seventies and eighties. As techno-fixes to political problems became ever more obvious attempts to paper over complex and deep-rooted social divisions, the public's belief in the virtues of technology faded. An associated skepticism toward expertise set in, which was accentuated when coupled with ideas of wasteful big government (in the United States, at least). Technological progress became more commonly associated with dystopias. Technological utopianism was a product of its time, and people were no longer buying it.

Why bother engaging with these writers from a forgotten movement? We have not realized the dreams of the first wave of technological utopians, that goes without saying. But in retrospect, these thinkers displayed an ironically unintended prescience, notably with regard to the social implications of the widespread technological development that ended up happening well after their lifetimes. Remarkably, technology capitalism is once more upheld as a significant contributor to improving our lot, to overcoming the problems we face in the twenty-first century. In the digital age, we are witnessing an ideological revitalization of the idea that utopia can be achieved by building more extreme versions of technology capitalism. It is a revival that imperils the ideals of democracy and equality.

The creators of the comedy television series *Silicon Valley* make regular visits to the headquarters of various tech companies to gather material for the show. They describe the Valley as a place where the hippie culture of San Francisco has "run headlong into rampant capitalism." One of the main characters in the series is Gavin Belson, <*p.105*> the slick and ruthless CEO of a Google-like company, Hooli. In one of his many pep talks to staff, he declares: "I don't know about you people, but I don't want to live in a world where someone else makes the world a better place better than we do."

Technology capitalism, from the late nineties onward, has become a redeemer of American capitalism at large. The exposed brick and steel of the proverbial Silicon Valley office seems like a world away from the decline of the manufacturing industries of the 1980s. Companies that design and sell technology are now some of the world's most profitable corporations. The tech industry has revived the economy, as part of the shiny project to bring together markets and communities all over the world.

Moreover, they are harbingers of convenience and interconnectedness in our individual lives, a picture of upbeat, self-actualizing capitalism. Eric Schmidt and Jonathan Rosenberg enthuse about how "infinite data and infinite computing power create an amazing playground for the world's smart creatives to solve big problems." They praise technology, like Google's smart contact lenses, that "continuously tracks a person's vital signs." Bernard Harcourt has written about how the Apple Watch allows us to measure, track and improve ourselves: extracting deeply intimate information, it creates a unique profile of intimate life. The technology is positioned as objectively futuristic: it can detect early symptoms of a heart attack, hours before ordinary medicine could detect anything. But it can also be tailored to the wearer: it gives us "the most complete picture" of our movements, so we can customize our exercise goals. This mass-produced piece of technology "makes the subject flourish in his or her individuality." Surveillance capitalism, disguised as a drive for personal efficiency, becomes equated with self-actualization.

This is the world that Richard Barbrook and Andy Cameron portrayed in their influential essay "The Californian Ideology," published in 1995. The authors described a burgeoning political philosophy centered on achieving individual freedom "through the natural laws of technological progress and the free market." Californian ideologues offer "technological proof to a libertarian political <*p.106*> philosophy ... therefore foreclosing on alternative futures." Gavin Belson may be a caricature, but he is not so distant from many real world figures in Silicon Valley who "promiscuously [combine] the free-wheeling spirit of the hippies and the entrepreneurial zeal of the yuppies." Detecting a mix of utopianism and fatalism, Barbrook and Cameron posit that this way of thinking sees political disputes about the alternatives as essentially meaningless. The future has arrived, even if it is yet to be evenly distributed outside the pleasant climes of Silicon Valley.

The social consequences of these developments read as eerily familiar. Engineers and tech entrepreneurs are treated with quasi-religious awe. It would not be a stretch to describe Steve Jobs, for example, as wielding priest-like power when he presided over the minimalist temple of the Apple Store. Elon Musk has been profiled as having "the boyish air of a nascent superhero [who] says his ultimate aim is to save humanity." Or take *Time* magazine on Mark Zuckerberg: "He's extremely smart, but he doesn't have any of the neurotic self-consciousness or self-doubt that often accompany high intelligence. His psyche, like his boyish face, is unlined ... His faith in himself and what he's doing is total."

It would be too easy to go on. Suffice to say there is a reverence for engineers and entrepreneurs who have presided over the rise of digital technology. They are looked to for guidance, for solace, for solutions to the problems plaguing humanity.

In other interesting ways, the utopians' vision has come to pass: the tech gurus, as before, are almost exclusively white men. The rigid gender roles that still persist in digital spaces echo some of the descriptions offered in first-wave technological utopian literature. Despite decades of progress for women's liberation in the twentieth century, the insular world of technology sometimes seems immune, as though hermetically sealed off from the outside world. Social media continues to be a cesspool of misogynistic abuse, and contradictory approaches to representations of women and their treatment prevail online. It all reflects a highly nineteenth-century attitude to gender equality. This is perhaps unsurprising, given that women <*p.107*> are still grossly underrepresented in the technology industry: in the United States, women make up a quarter of the tech workforce, while in the UK it is 17 percent.

To take one example, consider Facebook's policy on posts involving nudity. This policy has resulted in the repeated removal of images of breastfeeding; the deletion of an image of a fat woman in a bikini advertising an event about feminism and fatness; censorship of photos of Australian Aboriginal women performing a public ceremony as part of a protest, bare-breasted and wearing traditional body paint; and censorship of the iconic Pulitzer Prize--winning photograph by Nick Ut of children fleeing a napalm attack during the Vietnam War, which includes the naked, nine-year-old Kim Phúc. Meanwhile, images of nude and semi-nude women in sexualized and objectified poses are permitted to remain on the site in enormous volumes, especially if they depict celebrities. Implicit in these so-called community standards is an undeniable political agenda about women: sexualization and objectification of women's naked bodies is appropriate for the Facebook "community" (whoever that might be), but politicized images are less so. We are often told that traditional sexual roles and moralistic judgements of the choices we make in our personal lives are passé in the twenty-first century, but digital technology seems to have developed with these trends baked in.

Similarly, the technological utopians' ideas about politics have been reincarnated in recent decades. Social democratic parties in representative democracies increasingly consider themselves not as power brokers, ideologues or even representatives but rather as technocratic managers. Regulatory initiatives should be light-touch, according to this received wisdom, to avoid hampering "disruptors"---people who displace old ways of thinking with transformative new ideas. "Regulations get created in anticipation of problems," warn Eric Schmidt and Jonathan Rosenberg in their management book for Silicon Valley, *How Google Works*, "but if you build a system that anticipates everything, there's no room to innovate."

<*p.108*> Neoliberal democratic governments have been outsourcing state responsibilities to the private sector for decades now, and often see themselves not as agents for redistributing power but as experts tinkering with the large machinery of capitalism. Large scale welfare programs, like health and education, are constantly being rationalized and often outsourced to the private sector in the name of running them more efficiently. President Barack Obama assessed his first term as one characterized by "the disease of being policy wonks," describing how he was "very comfortable with a technocratic approach to government." More recently, the response to President Donald Trump's right-wing populism has been to devalue democracy and put more faith in elites as managers of social and political affairs. In the lead-up to the 2016 election, an influential essay by Andrew Sullivan entitled "Democracies End When They Are Too Democratic" argued for more control by elite political managers, "to protect this precious democracy from its own destabilizing excesses." While many of the technological utopians' projections did not come true, it is significant that the recent march of digital technology has coincided with an obsession with the perceived benefits of technocratic management of economic policy and other state functions, at the expense of democratic processes.

If anything, this desire to replace politics with technology has gone further in the twenty-first century, in ways that might surprise even the original technological utopians. Mainstream, legitimate players in the tech industry are seriously discussing and building whole new societies.

Balaji Srinivasan, an investor, entrepreneur and academic, has famously outlined what he calls the "ultimate exit." This may sound like a scheme to board the Hale-Bopp comet, and the reality is only a little less drastic. Srinivasan was referencing the economic theory about voice versus exit. This is the idea that members of a group (such as workers in a company or consumers in a market) have two choices when they are dissatisfied with deteriorating quality of the benefits of being a member: they can use their voice---by complaining, for example; or they can exit the group altogether. Srinivasan <*p.109*> reckons that it is time people did the latter: "build an opt-in society, ultimately outside the US, run by technology."

Elon Musk, the so-called wunderkind turned tech entrepreneur, started SpaceX in 2002 with the ultimate aim of colonizing Mars. He plans to launch the first cargo mission in coming years and recruit settlers to send out within the decade. Describing the spirit of these missions, Musk equates it, unabashed, with "the settlement of the New World by the colonists who crossed the Atlantic Ocean centuries ago." In his portrait of the digital age and its future, *Lo and Behold: Reveries of the Connected World*, Werner Herzog interviews Musk about his plan to settle humans on Mars; Musk claims it is "in case something goes wrong" with Earth. In response, the astronomer Lucianne Walkowicz points out in the next scene that "the focus on making Mars habitable distracts us from the fact that we are currently making Earth uninhabitable." With his widely admired company SpaceX, it seems that Musk is trying to use technology to literally create a whole new world as a way of exiting the current one, and in doing so he manifests a total acceptance of the settler-colonial narrative. His plan is to buy and exploit his way out of a dysfunctional society with his own self-designed utopia.

Peter Thiel, the venture capitalist, had focused his advocacy on sea-steading. In a 2009 essay, Thiel famously sets out how he "no longer believe[s] that freedom and democracy are compatible." He yearns for "an escape from politics in all its forms" by abandoning nationhood and settling the seas. Interestingly, Thiel includes a call to resist technological utopianism, at the same time as advocating for a form of utopianism:

> The future of technology is not pre-determined, and we must resist the temptation of technological utopianism---the notion that technology has a momentum or will of its own, that it will guarantee a more free future, and therefore that we can ignore the terrible arc of the political in our world.

<*p.110*> Ironically, Thiel has seemingly since abandoned his plans on the basis that they were perhaps unrealistic, conceding in 2015: "I'm not exactly sure that I'm going to succeed in building a libertarian utopia any time soon." He might be better off engaging a mesmerist and waiting out his perfect libertarian future, like Julian West. But he ought to prepare himself for a pretty long sleep.

There is a difference between technological determinism, which is perhaps a better description of what Thiel outlines above, and utopianism. It is possible to be an optimist about the future of technology and humanity, without that bubbling over into fantasy. Optimistic imaginings are important and even necessary. But the problems arise when we start imagining or even trying to create perfect worlds by taking current trends in technological development to extremes. This is not to say that we should stop using our imaginations or stop getting excited about the potential for technology to improve our lives. But how this technology is developed, and the extent of the improvement, are ultimately political questions. We should not confuse the advancement of technology in its current form with technological advancement for society as a whole.

Perhaps most importantly, technological utopianism blinds us to the ways in which it is possible to build a new world from political materials available in the present. We do not need an apocalypse or an exodus of the elite while the world burns in order to save humanity from itself. We need to work out how the structures of power and privilege in the present can be revolutionized to create a sustainable, flourishing and democratic society.

Digital technology, at least as much as any innovation over the last two centuries, offers us the opportunity to create a society that can meet the needs of every human being and allow them to explore their potential. But at present, too much power over the development of technology rests in the hands of technology capitalists and political elites who do their bidding. These people are good at what they do and also at convincing us that they are the best people to do it. They talk about egalitarianism and social connection in their public <*p.111*> relations pitches and marketing campaigns, but what they hope to gain from digital technology is different: they aspire to wealth and power.

If we are to think of alternatives to the heedless, vampire-like drive of technology capitalism, there are examples from history that are worthy of consideration. In looking back we should not dwell on the elites, who tend to dominate the social and cultural life of each generation by default rather than through any test of merit. By far the most interesting ideas about how to build alternative futures have instead come from below. Our past is full of these kinds of struggles, though they tend to be less well documented than the great-men-of-history narratives. People have been reinventing the received wisdom on how the world works for generations, and there is much to learn from these movements and struggles.

One iconic example comes from the tumultuous nineteenth century, just a few years before Bellamy published *Looking Backward*: the Paris Commune of 1871. It was a time when the French Revolution still loomed large in people's memories, and industrialization was wreaking havoc on traditional ways of doing things---not unlike how digital technology is transforming industrial production and social relationships today. As Bertell Ollman put it, "some were delighted by these developments, most were appalled, and everyone was amazed." These transformations destabilized the political balance of the continent. By 1871, the people of Paris were thoroughly sick of bearing the costs of imperial wars, which disproportionately fell to the poor and working people of France. Their new president, Adolphe Thiers, sensed the importance of imposing centralized control over the city, as it became clear that activists were gaining political momentum in the nation's capital by putting forth a more radical and democratic vision of a republic.

Paris became the epicenter of a face-off between the old ruling regime and the discontented workers. After suffering through a particularly bitter four-month-long siege at the hands of German armies, the local National Guard sensed the moment of disquiet and began to organize themselves into an alternative form of <*p.112*> government. Ensconced among the radical residents of Paris, the National Guard refused orders from Thiers to disarm the people. The situation became so unstable that Thiers decided to abandon Paris and set up government in Versailles, and the entire elite fled the city to follow him. The Communards, as they called themselves, took power.

In the months that followed, they turned Paris into an autonomously organized society, a commune that experimented with alternative ways of structuring social and political life based on collaboration and cooperation.

These improvised forms of self-government were so bold and transformative that they still provoke discussion and debate, a century and half later. They provide invaluable raw material for understanding alternatives to a society built on economic class and civil representation, opening up possibilities for deeper engagement with the ideas of democracy and equality that are worth examining today.

Who were the Communards exactly? Surveys taken later found that only a small percentage of them were professionals or small business owners. A full 84 percent of those left in control of Paris were manual laborers or wage earners. In this context, what happened next was probably a surprise to Thiers and his fellow elite, who showed contempt for the rabble they considered below them in social status. The Commune government addressed their constituents: "You are masters of your destiny. Strong in your support, the representatives that you have just established will repair the disasters caused by the fallen powers." Their manifesto was plastered on the walls of Paris:

> The recognition and consolidation of the Republic, the only form of Government compatible with the rights of the people and the regular and free development of society ... The absolute guarantee of individual liberty, of liberty of conscience and liberty of labour... It is the end of the old governmental and clerical world, of militarism, of monopolies, of privileges to which the proletariat owes its servitude, the country its miseries and disasters.

<*p.113*> True to this promise, the Commune unleashed some of the most radical ideas of participatory democracy the world had ever seen.

The Commune abolished conscription and the standing army; it decreed the separation of church and state, and converted all church property into national property; it declared education free, fixed the salaries of all judicial and associated justice workers, liberated political prisoners, suspended the payment of all rents for six months, publicly burned the guillotine, closed pawn shops, and abolished night work for bakers. That was just the beginning.

Workers began to organize their premises in ways that were decentralized and locally governed, with democratically elected administrators setting wages and enforcing limits on the length of the working day. They demanded equality and autonomy: "fair remuneration for their work, freedom of public assembly and the election of their own Municipal Council." The women of Paris embraced the opportunity for change presented by the Commune. They formed a Union des Femmes, advocating for equal pay for women working in factories in Paris, and were given significant public responsibilities by the Commune. It was the Commune's largest and most effective organization. Women achieved positions of power in the administration of the Commune that were unprecedented for the period. Marriage laws were liberalized, the administration offered financial support for both legitimate and illegitimate children of soldiers, and women even adapted their attire to suit the revolutionary moment. A Federation of Artists was formed, democratizing the administration of the fine arts in Paris and advocating for the funding of promising young artists who challenged establishment tastes. The president of the federation, the painter Gustave Courbet, summarized the prevailing feeling: "Paris is a true paradise ... All social groups have established themselves as federations and are masters of their own fate."

The central motivation of the Commune was the urge to improve the lives of the poor. These people had lived side by side before they took control of the city. They had fought as soldiers; they had worked together in factories; they had experienced the daily <*p.114*> humiliation of being poor in Parisian society, beholden to the whims of the elite. Through the process of struggle, they found they had a common notion of the enemy but they also began to develop shared ideas of how their skills and ingenuity could be put to use.

This outcome was hardly planned or expected. In writing about the Paris Commune, Marx talks about how the working class "did not expect miracles." They did not have a plan or destination in mind when they tore down the oppressive society they found themselves in. They had "no ready-made utopias to introduce by decree of the people," Marx wrote. But the Communards were a living example of how "any conditions which arise in historical time are capable of disappearing in historical time." They showed that it was possible for ordinary people to seize control of their own destiny, without the need for technocratic, religious or wealthy elites presiding over social affairs. As professor Kristin Ross puts it: "The Communards had not decreed or proclaimed the abolishment of the state. Rather, they had set about, step by step, dismantling, in the short time they had, all of its bureaucratic underpinnings." The outcome was visionary for the time, Ross says, but (I would argue) also by today's standards: "it produced a greater philosophy of freedom than either the Declaration of Independence or the Declaration of the Rights of Man, because it was *concrete*." The Paris Commune showed how cities and communities can be rebuilt in radical new ways, not by "innovating" their way out of social problems, but by empowering people to make decisions collectively.

Power in the hands of those disenfranchised by the system of industrial capitalism opened up a whole new way of doing things, where everything from work to social life and even artistic expression could be arranged differently. The process of struggle, Marx wrote, "set free the elements of the new society with which old collapsing bourgeois society itself is pregnant." In the rubble of the old structures from which the Communards were trying to break free, in the daily life of sharing, solidarity and attempts to build a new society, they found a map to a new way of existing that until then they had only conceived of in their imaginations.

<*p.115*> Ultimately the Commune was crushed. The "Bloody Week" in which Thiers, with a strengthened army, reconquered Paris resulted in around 25,000 Parisians and 877 soldiers slain. Thousands more Communards were imprisoned or deported to New Caledonia. As Carolyn Eichner put it: "The virulence of Versailles's violent repression of the Commune reflected the enormity of its perceived threat to existing gender, class, and religious hierarchies." It would be remiss to downplay such tragedies, and wrong to pretend that everything the Communards did was right or noble. But it would be foolish to equate the failings of the Communards with the catastrophic repression by Thiers. It would be equally unwise to judge the Commune's historical value in the light of its defeat.

The Commune tells us that it is possible to think of other ways of organizing, that alternative practices and principles for running society can spring forth, quite quickly, from the existing fabric of relationships and communities. Ordinary people can cooperate to render previously unshakable convictions about how things get done as fragile as gossamer. Working people are not stupid or gormless, and they require no "visionary" technologists to tell them how to run society. They have ideas of their own, and often they are pretty good ones.

Compare the ideas that emerged from the Paris Commune to, say, the thoughts of Marc Andreesson, the venture capitalist and cofounder of Mosaic and Netscape. Andreesson has long been idolized as a genius of Silicon Valley. "No one has done more than Marc Andreessen to change the way we communicate," writes Chris Anderson in his modestly titled profile, "The Man Who Makes the Future." Andreesson has been described as "an evangelist for the church of technology." He is not a utopian in the formal sense and does not describe himself as such, but he does believe that advancements in technology in their current form are beneficial, and he has done some thinking about what this might look like in the future.

In 2014, Andreesson wrote about his vision for the world of tomorrow using a thought experiment. "Imagine a world in which all material needs are provided for free, by robots and material <*p.116*> synthesizers." This kind of reality could solve some of the world's largest problems, a consumer utopia where people spend time pursuing creative, cultural and scientific ambitions, Andreesson claimed. At base, however, his vision was little more than a rather drab idea of ultra-capitalism: "I am not talking about Marxism or communism, I'm talking about democratic capitalism to the nth degree. Nor am I postulating the end of money or competition or status seeking or will to power, rather the full extrapolation of each of those."

Andreesson sees many of our collective problems, including inequality and unemployment, as functions of a society that clings to old ways of regulating and incentivizing economic activity. For him, a more fulsome embrace of technology capitalism will serve to strengthen society. Rather like the first wave of technological utopians, the folks who love creative destruction are also remarkably conservative in their thinking. "Firms trumpet their boldness, yet they often follow one another, lemming-like, pursuing the latest innovation," writes Tad Friend, about the venture capitalist firms of Silicon Valley, including the one that Andreesson founded. A tendency toward utopian thinking about technology makes it logical for someone like Andreesson to argue for more capitalism to solve the problems of capitalism.

In other words, utopian thinking can simultaneously present both a fantastically transcendent vision of tomorrow and a totally paralyzed understanding of the present, which obliterate the possibility of a genuinely different future. Bertell Ollman explains:

> Utopian thinking presents us with consequences (the ideal) without causes, i.e., causes capable of producing such consequences---and therefore too with causes (what exists now) that have no apparent consequences. It is not a matter of the present losing some of its potential; its entire future dimension has been wiped out. Hence, it is not only the future that gets distorted in utopian thinking but also the present. It is futureless because it does not itself exist as a cause of its own future.

<*p.117*> Utopianism erases our understanding of the present in a vision of the future that is supposedly detached from, yet ends up hopelessly bound to, the problems of the present. It is for this reason that some of the people lauded as the most visionary in our society end up having some of the most mundane ideas. Technology capitalists love to talk up the sparkling possibilities of technology---of unleashing potential in an interconnected society. But often what is revealed in these manifestos is little more than an unambitious extension of the status quo.

On one level, this is unsurprising: those who are satisfied with the basics of the present, who might quibble with the pace of change rather than its direction, often come up against the limits of their imagination. Their technological utopias either fail to come to terms with the root source of social ills or descend into sheer fantasy. This analysis underpinned the conclusion drawn by the British artist and socialist William Morris in his 1889 review of Bellamy's *Looking Backward*. "The only safe way of reading a utopia is to consider it as the expression of the temperament of its author," Morris observed. He found the book to be, like its author, "unhistoric and unartistic" and "perfectly satisfied with modern civilisation." Morris is today perhaps best known for his sumptuous, neomedieval decorative designs, but he was also committed to the struggles of the working class throughout his life, using his status and success to support and advocate for these movements from below. Through this engagement he saw the possibilities of a new kind of society and imagined the present changing the course of the future through political struggle. According to Morris, rather than being a representation of self-government or a dismantling of class, Bellamy's utopia was a state-managed monopoly economy, managed by "the industrious, *professional* middle-class." In short, Morris concluded: "Mr. Bellamy's ideas of life are curiously limited."

Morris was a critic worth listening to. He was, as noted by Kristin Ross, one of the "foremost British supporters of the memory of the Paris Commune." Having seen the scope of possibilities unleashed in Paris, Morris spent many years helping to define the Commune's <*p.118*> legacy, which he saw as a central question of his day. While he was pleased that Bellamy's work had inspired so many people to take an interest in the idea of socialism, he objected to its possibilities being framed as narrowly as they were in *Looking Backward*. In contrast to Bellamy's self-satisfied, unimaginative vision, Morris affirmed that

> there are some Socialists who ... [believe] it will be necessary for the unit of administration to be small enough for every citizen to feel himself responsible for its details, and be interested in them; that individual men cannot shuffle off the business of life on to the shoulders of an abstraction called the State, but must deal with it in conscious association with each other. That variety of life is as much an aim of true Communism as equality of condition, and that nothing but a union of these two will bring about real freedom.

Only by structuring society in ways that give everyday people genuine economic and social control over their lives, without subordination to some professional class of technocrats or capitalists, can we give rise to real freedom. For Morris, the great lesson of the Paris Commune was the possibility of this kind of society.

Capitalists and those content with our current form of civilization may struggle to imagine how society can meaningfully overthrow injustice, misery and waste. But it *is* possible for others to do this. It is possible for the present to be reclaimed as a cause of its own future, as Ollman might put it, if we think through how a future unlike the one promised by technology capitalism might come about.

The entire Internet and plenty of the basics of modern computing are based on free access to the infrastructure of digital technology. They are underpinned by a rejection of the idea of singular ownership and by a sense of the importance of collectively determining the basic standards that allow people to use, work and experiment together. For example, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is an international community of organizations and staff that work with the public to set the standards of the web. Its mission is "to lead the Web to its full potential" by defining standards around <*p.119*> web technologies "designed to promote consensus, fairness, public accountability, and quality." The W3C is by no means perfect and has its own schisms and conflicts. But it is organic, in the sense that it is a form of governance designed to be collaborative and interactive, which incidentally reflects how many people work within the technology industry already. In other words, the developments that gave rise to technology capitalism also allow for the possibility of structuring digital life in alternative ways. As Matt Bruenig observes:

> Were all of these tools developed along the same proprietary lines as the software that comes out of Microsoft or Apple, the web (and the ability to innovate on it) would look very different. You couldn't just start a Facebook in a dorm room; you'd need to shell out big money to pay for all the bits of software that go into a web server stack. The nearly frictionless ability to, if you know what you are doing, push out new internet-based tech products is solely the provenance of a community of sharing-driven programmers ideologically opposed, in varying degrees, to the capitalist ethic.

Something communal and collective has been built right alongside the technology that has developed in the individualistic, atomized pursuit of profit. So while we have Internet behemoths like Facebook that monetize our social interactions, we also have its raggedy equivalent in the form of craigslist, one of the most popular sites in the world, once described as "gigantic in scale and totally resistant to business cooperation." As Google seems to become ever more omnipotent, tiny competitors in the search engine market like DuckDuckGo attract users by pledging not to track them, collect their data or filter results into a personalized bubble. Just like we have major telecommunication companies cooperating with government to facilitate mass surveillance, we also have nonprofit software groups making free and open source applications to protect citizen communications with encryption. The market for web platform design and content management has produced enormous and profitable companies, but it has also produced WordPress and <*p.120*> Drupal, open source services for blogging and content management respectively. These services are used by nonprofits and community organizations all over the globe and, as Rebecca Mackinnon points out, "are developed, maintained, and upgraded by a community of volunteer developers."

Right alongside these efforts are the workers within technology capitalism doing their best to beat out spaces of resistance in the industry itself. Waves of radicalism are now eroding business as usual in Silicon Valley, as workers draw connections between the technology they build and the worst excesses of government and corporate power. Technology workers are creating a grassroots movement centered on a refusal to build technologies of violence and oppression, in favor of a world powered by technologies of peace and justice. Organizations such as the Tech Workers Coalition rally around workplace issues, as well as protesting outside Peter Thiel's company, Palantir. Similar groups are springing up in India and Brazil. They organize around industrial issues and broader political ones and actively draw the connection between the two.

These activists do not toil in the factories of Paris, nor do they build barricades out of cobblestones to keep the armies of the elite out of the communities they have created. But the people who make technology and the many more who use technology do often have a better grasp of what kind of alternative futures are possible if they are given the chance to put it into practice. What technology capitalists therefore produce, above all, are their own gravediggers.
