# Technological Utopianism Is Dangerous

## The Tech Billionaires Have Nothing on the Paris Commune

<*p.95*> Julian West lay down to sleep in his Boston home on the evening of May 31, 1887. He customarily slept in a sealed chamber, a soundproof cellar below his house, in an effort to address his chronic insomnia. To assist him in falling asleep. West also hired the services of an alternative therapist. "I called in Dr. Pillsbury, [who] called himself a 'Professor of Animal Magnetism,'" explained West. "I don't think he knew anything about medicine, but he was certainly a remarkable mesmerist."

He was indeed. As a result of a fire that destroyed West's house that night, and a particularly profound form of mesmerizing animal magnetism, the insomniac awoke on the afternoon of September 10, 2000---113 years later. He was discovered by the new owner of his house while excavating the back garden, prior to building a subterranean laboratory. The new owner explained to West that he was now in what had been the distant future.

West remained unconvinced of this passage of time, and it was only when his host showed him the skyline of modern Boston that he began to realize his predicament. "Every quarter contained large open squares filled with trees, among which statues glistened and fountains flashed in the late afternoon sun. Public buildings of a colossal size and an architectural grandeur unparalleled in my day <*p.96*> raised their stately piles on every side," he recalled. "I knew then that I had been told the truth concerning the prodigious thing which had befallen me." West spent the remainder of his life exploring this wonderland of a future, with its advanced industrial organization and domestic automation ensuring a bountiful existence for all citizens, the product of technological development.

This may seem like an overly elaborate set-up to a novel, but it was one of the most popular fictions of its day. Published in 1887, Edward Bellamy's *Looking Backward* was arguably "the most widely read and influential utopian tract of all time" and inspired "Bellamy clubs" across the country. The idea of a utopian future in which the problems of the present were miraculously resolved and society was organized efficiently and fairly captured the fancy of a whole generation.

Imagining a better world has occupied humans for millennia. It is a powerful elixir, the idea of a society of stability and sufficiency; it can be a source of motivation to strive for something better, as well as a method for highlighting the shortcomings of the present. Utopianism is the practice of taking these imaginings to extremes, applying innovative and creative ways of thinking to work out the logistics of a future perfect society. But problems arise because these visions of the future are often detached in causal terms from the troubles of the present. Utopians prefer taking imaginary shortcuts to a new world, like Bellamy's protagonist's overly long nap, offering little guidance about how to actually get there. The Boston in which West awakens feels vigorous and modern, a society motivated by equality and respect, powered by futuristic technology. Though Bellamy never identified it as such, it was commonly understood as a form of utopian socialism. But while we are free to imagine this perfect society, we remain fettered by its impossibility. If this kind of thinking creates a yardstick by which to measure our progress and an ideal to aim toward, it also renders our imaginations a salve rather than a cure.

Bellamy's novel was exciting because it reframed basic assumptions about the intractability of human misery. "It is a mystery," <*p.97*> muses the host from modern Boston, Dr. Leete, reflecting on the past West used to inhabit, "how men with children could favor a system under which they were rewarded beyond those less endowed with bodily strength or mental power." Bellamy's future was one of universal sharing and industriousness, and such images have a moral weight. But the method of arriving at this destination remained persistently obscure throughout the novel. "All that society had to do was to recognize and cooperate with [industrial] evolution," explains Dr. Leete, with little further detail. Technological optimization, it seems, was Bellamy's pathway to utopia. The assumption has had a long legacy.

There is another tendency running through some forms of utopianism that can also serve the darker purpose of obfuscation. The idea that these imaginary future societies are actually detached from the present is often, ironically, an illusion. Without a proper understanding of the nature of the problems of the present, these visions for the future offer solutions that look remarkably similar in structure to the world they are trying to escape. Utopians often seek to beguile the problem of politics, to bypass negotiating the messy and complex networks of power relations between ruler and ruled. But in doing so, it is too easy to fall into the trap of reproducing the structures that give rise to current misery, with little more than a vacuous overlay of supposedly reasonable, enlightened thinking by those with already enough power to appoint themselves to the job of shaping such societies. Utopianism can abridge our capacity to imagine what true emancipation might look like.

In *Looking Backward*, for example, Bellamy paints a futuristic society made up of a "federal system of autonomous nations," each with its own "industrial army," that looks not unlike a benevolent version of state-run, monopolistic capitalism. It is never clear how this social and economic system avoids the problems that West had left behind in the previous century. If we fail to transform the structures that give rise to social and economic inequality, advances in all fields of human endeavor will remain beholden to these problems---and so too will the imagined solutions.

<*p.98*> The challenge is to use our imaginations without falling into undiscerning, insidious utopianism. Can we come up with an ideal society in our thoughts but one that also exists with reference to the present? Right around the time Bellamy was writing, Oscar Wilde made a forceful case against capitalism in his essay *The Soul of Man under Socialism* and expounded the vital importance of a world in which "poverty was impossible." In it, he was right to argue that "a map of the world that does not include Utopia is not worth even glancing at." But it is also worth remembering that a map of the world that includes Utopia must be grounded in some kind of mate rial reality; it will offer a route for getting there.

Technological utopianism is a specific vision of the future. It sees technological progress as the means to bring about a perfect society. To this extent, technology serves as a remedy for human weakness, doing a range of jobs faster and better than we ever could, overcoming the limitations of the natural environment, and creating the foundations of a genuine meritocracy free from the chaos of human society. Its supporters believe that technology, developed to the extreme, or optimized, has the capacity to generate a virtuous society of abundance.

Utopianism has a long history. But the specific kind of thinking popularized in Bellamy's *Looking Backward* saw its heyday in America between the 1880s and the early 1930s. Technological utopians were living in times of labour unrest, arising from the grimy and at times brutal developments and after-effects of the industrial revolution. Their work illuminated some of the anxieties of their day and applied constructive thinking to how technology could address them. Their movement, insofar as it could be called one, shared certain values and tendencies. From a theoretical perspective, it seized upon what they saw as the most important contemporary trend in society---the development of technology---and attempted to predict the outcomes of its advance and spread.

The shared vision stitched together from these individual texts reveals several common threads. These men (as they all were) had <*p.99*> exciting hopes for the future; there is something precious about their optimistic exercises in fantasy.

The result is a set of imaginary worlds that look remarkably similar: highly organized, free from the filth and chaos of the industrial revolution, clean, efficient, and able to satisfy the needs of its inhabitants. Technology was shown to improve every aspect of human life---from production to housework, urban planning, and even the weather. How exactly this would happen was never fully explained, but it tended to involve large-scale machinery designed by engineers and tended to by workers. New inventions, such as personalized, compact electric motors, or glass with the strength and malleability of metal, facilitated the construction of vast and beautiful cityscapes and urban living spaces. Communal kitchens produced meals for everyone, punctually, without waste. Education was widely accessible; dangerous work was obsolete. The end of selfishness and monopolistic enterprise reduced inefficiencies and raised the living standards of the traditionally disenfranchised.

But while this was imaginative and innovative, there was also something of a conservative strain running through the ideas of technological utopians. Historian Howard P. Segal talks of how their writings often formed "a movement not of revolt but of antithesis---a movement seeking to alter the speed with which American society was moving but not the direction." They saw themselves not as creators of something new but as advocates for a progress already underway. Their writings resisted a sophisticated examination of the deficiencies of the present by conjuring a distinct and better future.

This left an unavoidable black hole in the logic of first-wave technological utopians. They argued that a future perfect society was a logical extension of the present---it could be generated by animating existing social trends---yet it was unclear how this might come about in practice. Very little is ever said about this point: the onset of utopia was typically skipped over as simply a logical outcome of technological advancement. To the extent the point was addressed, utopian writers described their ideal societies transpiring as a consequence of various vague factors that accelerated development, <*p.100*> such as greater intelligence among the masses, recognition of and cooperation with industrial evolution, the unstoppable expansion of corporations, and the transformative ability to manufacture power. In other words, technological utopia was understood as the natural progression of capitalist development.

Glossing over the intricacies of cause and effect is a convenient storytelling device, but it also reveals something deeper about this kind of thinking. It manifests a desire to avoid a proper reckoning with the causes of problems in the present and, as such, any clear theory about how they might be changed. For some technological utopians, like Bellamy, this took the form of a mostly benign escapism, which provided a rich and compelling portrait of an equitable world of human flourishing. While there was diversity in how they approached their narrative, the technological utopians writing in the decades after the industrial revolution displayed common tendencies and philosophical bents, and they sparked a movement of sorts focused on a brighter future. But whether unconsciously or by design, many of these utopian worlds had a way of echoing trends of inequality that existed in their own society. It was symptomatic of a certain form of political blindness.

Most obviously, this can be found in the set of social and political relations that complemented the utopian concept of economic order. For example, in many of the technological utopians' writings, those with a mastery of technology formed a new elite class, commanding respect and deference. In George S. Morison's book, *The New Epoch as Developed by the Manufacture of Power* (1903), engineers were literally revered:

> [the engineer] is the priest of material development, of the work which enables other men to enjoy the fruits of the great sources of power in nature, and of the power of mind over matter. He is the priest of the new epoch, a priest without superstitions.

The rest of society was obliged to toil on the machines these engineers created. In King Camp Gillette's manifesto *World Corporation* <*p.101*> (1924), humans became part of the machinery itself---"cogs in the machine, acting in response to the will of a corporate mind." Just as the capitalists dictated to workers in the industrial revolution, so too would engineers preside over a society that treated people as a kind of machinery.

This instrumental understanding of people entailed markedly ascetic views about free time. In *The Diothas* by John Macnie (1883), for example, people only worked up to three hours a day, yet inactivity was reproved: "If any live in idleness, it is evident that others must toil to support them. Time-honored custom, therefore, requires that all children, whether boys or girls, shall acquire some handicraft." In *Looking Backward*, neglect of work in the "industrial army" was punished with bread and water in solitary confinement. Similarly, despite labor-saving technology that meant that people need only work two hours a day, it was not a life of leisure in Henry Olerich's *A Cityless and Countryless World* (1893). "We teach that labour is necessary and honourable, that idleness is robbery and disgrace," declares the protagonist, a visitor to Earth from a utopian society on Mars. Workers were expected to devote any free time to self-improvement. Free time in utopia, it seems, was not actually free. This kind of attitude fits with the prevailing views at the turn of the century, when industriousness was highly valued and respected. (Indeed, Bertrand Russell penned an entire dissenting essay in 1932 called *In Praise of Idleness*, affirming that "there is far too much work done in the world, that immense harm is caused by the belief that work is virtuous.")

Given the obsession with efficiency and productivity as the path to self-actualization, self-control was the defining feature of intimate relationships in these technological utopias. Social interactions were definitively distant. Reproduction was often considered the sole purpose of sex, with licentiousness considered "unchaste" and "impure." Though basic forms of equality were recognized for women---in ways often far ahead of their time, and even ahead of our current state of affairs---family structures and sexual mores remained rigid. Though some technological utopians envisaged <*p.102*> lives of fierce social and political equality for women, the usual whiff of sexism often accompanied such visions. "It is their privilege," remarks the guide in *The Diothas* in reference to women, "to be beautiful, and in some measure, a social obligation to keep themselves so." Their job, in that particular utopia, was mainly housework. The reproduction of discriminatory attitudes to women in these imaginary societies would come as no surprise to many modern women, given it was mostly privileged men penning the words.

Technological utopians also cast off democracy; technical expertise was much more important for running a virtuous society. "Politics which we recognize as a necessary governmental part of our competitive, industrial system will have no place under the 'World Corporation,'" wrote Gillette. "There will be no voting, no political campaigns, and no favourites of fortune, either socially or industrially, except those who by study, application, perseverance, intelligence, and ability earn and by right attain positions in the World Corporate System." Voting was seen as a poor way to make decisions, especially when technology and technocrats could do it better. "Administration in a technocracy has to do with material factors which are subject to measurement," argued Harold Loeb in *Life in a Technocracy* (1933). "Therefore, popular voting can be largely dispensed with. It is stupid deciding an issue by a vote or opinion when a yardstick can be used." According to these writers, the optimization of technology would free society from the problem of politics, and social democracy would be superseded by more logical and cohesive organizing principles.

These utopias often put on display an imagined solution to unequal economic distribution and social disharmony that was just more of the same: more capitalism, technologically optimized. The entire premise of Gillette's utopia was that society be run as a giant corporation. He believed the industrial and political system was similar to a piece of machinery, which could be improved with the help of a scientific approach to design. To "complete the industrial evolution" wrote Gillette, the idea of a singular, enormous corporation "has power to join in harmony millions and millions of <*p.103*> individuals, and, where chaos reigned, order and system takes its place." The democratic organization of society stood in the way of advances being made by the corporate structure: "The most serious obstruction to material progress is our present Government and its political parties and machinery ... These same men would have been among the enraged mob who destroyed the looms in an English mill less than a hundred years ago."

The description of the "logical evolution" that society underwent in Bellamy's *Looking Backward* was almost identical to Gillette's idea of a single corporation:

> The nation ... organized as the one great business corporation in which all other corporations were absorbed; it became the one capitalist in the place of all other capitalists, the sole employer, the final monopoly in which all previous and lesser monopolies were swallowed up, a monopoly in the profits and economies of which all citizens shared.

In *A Cityless and Countryless World*, such monopolies are shunned, but utopia is still achieved via an extreme form of capitalism: "*free* competition, of *healthy* supply and demand" rather than substandard "monopolistic laws."

While these technological utopians showed dazzling imagination and an infectious enthusiasm for the future, they were also susceptible to some surprisingly conservative and unsavory ideas. In some cases, these intellectual shortcomings stemmed from an indifference to the social and political work that needed to be done to transform their visions into reality. In other cases, they derived from an uncritical embrace of capitalist economic and social relations, which inevitably influenced how technology developed. Often it was a mix of both. As capitalism escalates, and especially as technology develops, political, social and economic democracy necessarily decreases. This was a criticism that many of the technological utopians were unconcerned by, or unwilling to entertain. The result was that these various utopias were either appealing but unachievable, or achievable but not very appealing.

<*p.104*> Today these texts feel clunky and outdated. The movement, insofar as their shared vision and common popularity constituted one, dissipated. Segal argues that World War Two turned the idea of a utopia arising from technological development into a dystopia. There was a drift away from optimistic faith in technology after the Vietnam War; as the environmental damage associated with technology became clearer, the economy lost momentum and conservatism became ascendant throughout the seventies and eighties. As techno-fixes to political problems became ever more obvious attempts to paper over complex and deep-rooted social divisions, the public's belief in the virtues of technology faded. An associated skepticism toward expertise set in, which was accentuated when coupled with ideas of wasteful big government (in the United States, at least). Technological progress became more commonly associated with dystopias. Technological utopianism was a product of its time, and people were no longer buying it.

Why bother engaging with these writers from a forgotten movement? We have not realized the dreams of the first wave of technological utopians, that goes without saying. But in retrospect, these thinkers displayed an ironically unintended prescience, notably with regard to the social implications of the widespread technological development that ended up happening well after their lifetimes. Remarkably, technology capitalism is once more upheld as a significant contributor to improving our lot, to overcoming the problems we face in the twenty-first century. In the digital age, we are witnessing an ideological revitalization of the idea that utopia can be achieved by building more extreme versions of technology capitalism. It is a revival that imperils the ideals of democracy and equality.

The creators of the comedy television series *Silicon Valley* make regular visits to the headquarters of various tech companies to gather material for the show. They describe the Valley as a place where the hippie culture of San Francisco has "run headlong into rampant capitalism." One of the the main characters in the series is Gavin Belson, <*p.105*> the slick and ruthless CEO of a Google-like company, Hooli. In one of his many pep talks to staff, he declares: "I don't know about you people, but I don't want to live in a world where someone else makes the world a better place better than we do."

Technology capitalism, from the late nineties onward, has become a redeemer of American capitalism at large. The exposed brick and steel of the proverbial Silicon Valley office seems like a world away from the decline of the manufacturing industries of the 1980s. Companies that design and sell technology are now some of the world's most profitable corporations. The tech industry has revived the economy, as part of the shiny project to bring together markets and communities all over the world.

Moreover, they are harbingers of convenience and interconnectedness in our individual lives, a picture of upbeat, self-actualizing capitalism. Eric Schmidt and Jonathan Rosenberg enthuse about how "infinite data and infinite computing power create an amazing playground for the world's smart creatives to solve big problems." They praise technology, like Google's smart contact lenses, that "continuously tracks a person's vital signs." Bernard Harcourt has written about how the Apple Watch allows us to measure, track and improve ourselves: extracting deeply intimate information, it creates a unique profile of intimate life. The technology is positioned as objectively futuristic: it can detect early symptoms of a heart attack, hours before ordinary medicine could detect anything. But it can also be tailored to the wearer: it gives us "the most complete picture" of our movements, so we can customize our exercise goals. This mass-produced piece of technology "makes the subject flourish in his or her individuality." Surveillance capitalism, disguised as a drive for personal efficiency, becomes equated with self-actualization.

This is the world that Richard Barbrook and Andy Cameron portrayed in their influential essay "The Californian Ideology," published in 1995. The authors described a burgeoning political philosophy centered on achieving individual freedom "through the natural laws of technological progress and the free market." Californian ideologues offer "technological proof to a libertarian political <*p.106*> philosophy ... therefore foreclosing on alternative futures." Gavin Belson may be a caricature, but he is not so distant from many real world figures in Silicon Valley who "promiscuously [combine] the free-wheeling spirit of the hippies and the entrepreneurial zeal of the yuppies." Detecting a mix of utopianism and fatalism, Barbrook and Cameron posit that this way of thinking sees political disputes about the alternatives as essentially meaningless. The future has arrived, even if it is yet to be evenly distributed outside the pleasant climes of Silicon Valley.

The social consequences of these developments read as eerily familiar. Engineers and tech entrepreneurs are treated with quasi-religious awe. It would not be a stretch to describe Steve Jobs, for example, as wielding priest-like power when he presided over the minimalist temple of the Apple Store. Elon Musk has been profiled as having "the boyish air of a nascent superhero [who] says his ultimate aim is to save humanity." Or take *Time* magazine on Mark Zuckerberg: "He's extremely smart, but he doesn't have any of the neurotic self-consciousness or self-doubt that often accompany high intelligence. His psyche, like his boyish face, is unlined ... His faith in himself and what he's doing is total."

It would be too easy to go on. Suffice to say there is a reverence for engineers and entrepreneurs who have presided over the rise of digital technology. They are looked to for guidance, for solace, for solutions to the problems plaguing humanity.

In other interesting ways, the utopians' vision has come to pass: the tech gurus, as before, are almost exclusively white men. The rigid gender roles that still persist in digital spaces echo some of the descriptions offered in first-wave technological utopian literature. Despite decades of progress for women's liberation in the twentieth century, the insular world of technology sometimes seems immune, as though hermetically sealed off from the outside world. Social media continues to be a cesspool of misogynistic abuse, and contradictory approaches to representations of women and their treatment prevail online. It all reflects a highly nineteenth-century attitude to gender equality. This is perhaps unsurprising, given that women <*p.107*>
