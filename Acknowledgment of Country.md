# Acknowledgment of Country

<*p.ix*> I wish to acknowledge the traditional owners of the land on which this book was written. I pay my respects to the elders of this country and to the custodians of the land today. I offer them solidarity. In Australia and in the United States, that land was stolen, and sovereignty was never ceded. I am grateful for the opportunity to live on this country. It always was and always will be Aboriginal land.
